p00007_A,00007,A,paul
p00008_A,00008,A,don t let them know they are never to know
p00009_A,00009,A,they do not love any longer if you prefer it put that way
p00010_A,00010,A,i love you
p00011_A,00011,A,do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst
p00012_A,00012,A,you girls are so wonderful in always having oh dear one mustn t talk
p00013_A,00013,A,now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing
p00014_A,00014,A,on the what dear
p00015_A,00015,A,on the drum aunt juley
p00016_A,00016,A,margaret is helen all right
p00017_A,00017,A,oh yes
p00018_A,00018,A,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p00019_A,00019,A,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p00020_A,00020,A,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p00021_A,00021,A,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
p00022_A,00022,A,it isn t of any consequence
p00023_A,00023,A,but of course it is tibby tibby
p00024_A,00024,A,what what the pomp and circumstance will not be fine
p00025_A,00025,A,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p00026_A,00026,A,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p00027_A,00027,A,margaret margaret margaret fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat
p00028_A,00028,A,might i couldn t i
p00029_A,00029,A,oh i would be so grateful
p00030_A,00030,A,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley no one could it s unmistakable
p00031_A,00031,A,a specially loud part of course i do not go in for being musical i only care for music a very different thing but still i will say this for myself i do know when i like a thing and when i don t some people are the same about pictures they can go into a picture gallery miss conder can and say straight off what they feel all round the wall i never could do that but music is so different from pictures to my mind when it comes to music i am as safe as houses and i assure you tibby i am by no means pleased by everything there was a thing something about a faun in french which helen went into ecstasies over but i thought it most tinkling and superficial and said so and i held to my opinion too
p00032_A,00032,A,helen you must not be so ramshackly you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall and he has had the trouble of coming round for it
p00033_A,00033,A,oh i am so sorry i do nothing but steal umbrellas i am so very sorry do come in and choose one is yours a hooky or a nobbly mine s a nobbly at least i think it is
p00034_A,00034,A,don t you see that you ve frightened him away i meant him to stop to tea you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable no it s not a bit of good now
p00035_A,00035,A,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p00036_A,00036,A,aunt juley how can you you make me more and more ashamed i d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i well i must shut the front door i suppose one more failure for helen
p00037_A,00037,A,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p00038_A,00038,A,why he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well
p00039_A,00039,A,in a way i wish we had a real boy in the house the kind of boy who cares for men it would make entertaining so much easier
p00040_A,00040,A,why didn t you make that young man welcome tibby you must do the host a little you know you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
p00041_A,00041,A,oh it s no good looking superior i mean what i say
p00042_A,00042,A,leave tibby alone
p00043_A,00043,A,here s the house a regular hen coop
p00044_A,00044,A,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p00045_A,00045,A,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p00046_A,00046,A,a touch of the w s perhaps
p00047_A,00047,A,who are the w s
p00048_A,00048,A,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p00049_A,00049,A,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p00050_A,00050,A,that house being the w s house i presume
p00051_A,00051,A,good evening mr bast
p00052_A,00052,A,oh margaret such a most unfortunate thing has happened i could not get you alone coming up no doubt in the hope of getting into london society
p00053_A,00053,A,and helen must be careful too
p00054_A,00054,A,nothing
p00055_A,00055,A,it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons where the plants are in the balcony what helen you don t mind them coming do you
p00056_A,00056,A,well you look grave doesn t she frieda
p00057_A,00057,A,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack
p00058_A,00058,A,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p00059_A,00059,A,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p00060_A,00060,A,come helen
p00061_A,00061,A,go helen
p00062_A,00062,A,helen his mother has forgiven you
p00063_A,00063,A,bother the whole family helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing why can t the woman leave us alone
p00064_A,00064,A,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p00065_A,00065,A,most certainly her love has died
p00066_A,00066,A,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
p00067_A,00067,A,but meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young o lud who s that coming down the stairs i vow tis my brother o crimini
p00068_A,00068,A,inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching
p00069_A,00069,A,indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself
p00070_A,00070,A,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
p00071_A,00071,A,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do
p00072_A,00072,A,i am not sure that i agree do you
p00073_A,00073,A,i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
p00074_A,00074,A,on what grounds do they feel that the continent is in bad form
p00075_A,00075,A,never mind us or her do say
p00076_A,00076,A,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p00077_A,00077,A,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p00078_A,00078,A,i don t know i don t know
p00079_A,00079,A,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p00080_A,00080,A,my husband and our daughter are motoring
p00081_A,00081,A,bertha too oh fancy what a coincidence do you know i ll wait on second thoughts i ll wait there s plenty of time still isn t there and i shall be able to get evie s opinion
p00082_A,00082,A,later on i should love it but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we re fresh isn t the house shut up too might i come some other day
p00083_A,00083,A,back to wickham place please
p00084_A,00084,A,no motor smash changed plans father s coming
p00085_A,00085,A,miss schlegel our little outing must be for another day
p00086_A,00086,A,another day mrs wilcox of course
p00087_A,00087,A,but as we ve insured against third party risks it won t so much matter
p00088_A,00088,A,cart and car being practically at right angles
p00089_A,00089,A,i didn t want to henry i might have been wrong and every one hates illnesses
p00090_A,00090,A,father s eaten nothing
p00091_A,00091,A,impossible
p00092_A,00092,A,butter dolly
p00093_A,00093,A,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
p00094_A,00094,A,charles
p00095_A,00095,A,one minute i m busy well crane who s been driving it do you suppose
p00096_A,00096,A,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p00097_A,00097,A,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p00098_A,00098,A,i can t of course say for the time i ve been in yorkshire no more mud now sir
p00099_A,00099,A,she wants howards end
p00100_A,00100,A,no sir
p00101_A,00101,A,howards end
p00102_A,00102,A,dolly go back at once my father s much annoyed with you charles come in at once to father he s had a letter that s too awful
p00103_A,00103,A,oh mr wilcox
p00104_A,00104,A,come evie don t waste time sit down
p00105_A,00105,A,a note in my mother s handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed inside no date no signature forwarded through the matron of that nursing home now the question is
p00106_A,00106,A,why it s only in pencil i said so pencil never counts
p00107_A,00107,A,that she would have that it is a case of undue influence no to my mind the question is the the invalid s condition at the time she wrote
p00108_A,00108,A,why you just said it was
p00109_A,00109,A,never mind if i did and hold your tongue
p00110_A,00110,A,mother believed so in ancestors too it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider who d never appreciate
p00111_A,00111,A,the whole thing is unlike her if miss schlegel had been poor if she had wanted a house i could understand it a little but she has a house of her own why should she want another she wouldn t have any use for howards end
p00112_A,00112,A,presumably she knows mother will have told her she got twice or three times into the nursing home presumably she is awaiting developments
p00113_A,00113,A,what a horrid woman
p00114_A,00114,A,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p00115_A,00115,A,that paul business was pretty scandalous though
p00116_A,00116,A,i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she s honest she s not in collusion with the matron i m absolutely certain of it nor was she with the doctor i m equally certain of that she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are she like ourselves was a dupe you see charles in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known well miss schlegel s position has been equally false take all in all she has not come out of it badly
p00117_A,00117,A,but those chrysanthemums
p00118_A,00118,A,or coming down to the funeral at all
p00119_A,00119,A,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p00120_A,00120,A,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p00121_A,00121,A,i hope charles took the hint
p00122_A,00122,A,yes that is to say her husband wrote later on and thanked me for being a little kind to her and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette don t you think that is extraordinarily generous it has made me like him very much he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future i like mr wilcox he is taking up his work rubber it is a big business i gather he is launching out rather charles is in it too charles is married a pretty little creature but she doesn t seem wise they took on the flat but now they have gone off to a house of their own
p00123_A,00123,A,but what an extraordinary
p00124_A,00124,A,i hope you were pleased
p00125_A,00125,A,tibby had better first wonder what he ll do cheers children it s mrs lanoline
p00126_A,00126,A,it was a concert at the queen s hall i think you will recollect when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
p00127_A,00127,A,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done so i m not sure do you remember helen
p00128_A,00128,A,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back
p00129_A,00129,A,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
p00130_A,00130,A,this afternoon call
p00131_A,00131,A,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p00132_A,00132,A,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p00133_A,00133,A,it was good of you to come and explain the rest is naturally no concern of ours
p00134_A,00134,A,don t talk to me about the pole star i know its little ways it goes round and round and you go round after it
p00135_A,00135,A,but not good country there is it
p00136_A,00136,A,did you actually go off the roads
p00137_A,00137,A,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way
p00138_A,00138,A,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p00139_A,00139,A,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater
p00140_A,00140,A,then you don t think i was foolish
p00141_A,00141,A,heavens no
p00142_A,00142,A,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p00143_A,00143,A,oh bother not to say dash i had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
p00144_A,00144,A,why better
p00145_A,00145,A,i know but people don t go then perhaps you know best but never forget you re better than jefferies
p00146_A,00146,A,len who s miss schlegel
p00147_A,00147,A,have i i thought i had a million
p00148_A,00148,A,personal supervision and mutual help
p00149_A,00149,A,what an age it is since i ve seen you mr wilcox i met evie in the tube though lately i hope you have good news of your son
p00150_A,00150,A,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting
p00151_A,00151,A,sounds a most original entertainment i wish evie would go to that sort of thing but she hasn t the time she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers jolly little dogs
p00152_A,00152,A,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p00153_A,00153,A,quickness
p00154_A,00154,A,yes quickness in argument time after time i ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven t oh i believe in these discussions oh yes it doesn t much matter what subject you take
p00155_A,00155,A,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case
p00156_A,00156,A,what in
p00157_A,00157,A,porphyrion fire insurance company
p00158_A,00158,A,oh yes the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug he seems interesting in some ways very and one wishes one could help him he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much he likes books and what one may roughly call adventure and if he had a chance but he is so poor he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink well he got mixed up in our debate he wasn t the subject of it but it seemed to bear on his point suppose a millionaire died and desired to leave money to help such a man how should he be helped should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct which was margaret s plan most of them thought this would pauperise him should he and those like him be given free libraries i said no he doesn t want more books to read but to read books rightly my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday but then there is his wife and they said she would have to go too nothing seemed quite right now what do you think imagine that you were a millionaire and wanted to help the poor what would you do
p00159_A,00159,A,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid
p00160_A,00160,A,i hadn t thought of that
p00161_A,00161,A,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p00162_A,00162,A,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring
p00163_A,00163,A,certainly i won t say in fact i don t know what that means
p00164_A,00164,A,human nature i suppose
p00165_A,00165,A,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other
p00166_A,00166,A,and mine
p00167_A,00167,A,next september
p00168_A,00168,A,every one moving good bye
p00169_A,00169,A,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p00170_A,00170,A,do yes that s worth doing let us
p00171_A,00171,A,sugar
p00172_A,00172,A,ladies brighten
p00173_A,00173,A,yes i know the darlings are regular sunbeams let me give you a plate
p00174_A,00174,A,your company is the porphyrion isn t it
p00175_A,00175,A,yes that s so it s funny how things get round
p00176_A,00176,A,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p00177_A,00177,A,i couldn t say some would tell you one thing and others another for my own part i only believe half i hear not that even it s safer those clever ones come to the worse grief i ve often noticed ah you can t be too careful
p00178_A,00178,A,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p00179_A,00179,A,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether
p00180_A,00180,A,then he is right partly mr bast i don t understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong our friend who is also a business man was so positive he said before christmas
p00181_A,00181,A,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p00182_A,00182,A,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p00183_A,00183,A,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p00184_A,00184,A,we brought the little fellows round
p00185_A,00185,A,i bred em myself
p00186_A,00186,A,i ve got to be going now
p00187_A,00187,A,but play with puppies a little first
p00188_A,00188,A,this is ahab that s jezebel
p00189_A,00189,A,i ve got to be going
p00190_A,00190,A,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p00191_A,00191,A,to help you you silly boy and don t shout
p00192_A,00192,A,highly unfair
p00193_A,00193,A,so do i you were that last sunday you are this to day mr bast i and my sister have talked you over we wanted to help you we also supposed you might help us we did not have you here out of charity which bores us but because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days what is the good of your stars and trees your sunrise and the wind if they do not enter into our daily lives they have never entered into mine but into yours we thought haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness against pettiness against mechanical cheerfulness against suspicion i struggle by remembering my friends others i have known by remembering some place some beloved place or tree we thought you one of these
p00194_A,00194,A,of course if there s been any misunderstanding all i can do is to go but i beg to state you were picking my brain for official information i can prove it i
p00195_A,00195,A,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand
p00196_A,00196,A,but really ought she to
p00197_A,00197,A,i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves i didn t interfere you were splendid miss schlegel absolutely splendid you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
p00198_A,00198,A,oh yes
p00199_A,00199,A,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me
p00200_A,00200,A,no
p00201_A,00201,A,yes indeed
p00202_A,00202,A,with you
p00203_A,00203,A,naughty young man
p00204_A,00204,A,naughty when you re married miss wilcox won t you want outside interests
p00205_A,00205,A,he has apparently got them
p00206_A,00206,A,oh i dare say
p00207_A,00207,A,surely he has some opinion
p00208_A,00208,A,he s very clever isn t he
p00209_A,00209,A,he s gone with my blessing and now for puppies
p00210_A,00210,A,helen s right enough but i can t stand the toothy one and i shouldn t have called either of them girls
p00211_A,00211,A,evie i like that miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her
p00212_A,00212,A,i want a new home in september and some one must find it i can t
p00213_A,00213,A,never any good just listen to her never any good oh come
p00214_A,00214,A,well you aren t miss schlegel is he
p00215_A,00215,A,i don t care you ve made two damaging admissions and i m heartily with you in both
p00216_A,00216,A,you needn t go though
p00217_A,00217,A,no we have no real ties
p00218_A,00218,A,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p00219_A,00219,A,there s nothing rash to do
p00220_A,00220,A,who are the wilcoxes
p00221_A,00221,A,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p00222_A,00222,A,it will be as easy as eating
p00223_A,00223,A,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating
p00224_A,00224,A,bungle my dear you are too little to recollect in fact you weren t there but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with baby who was margaret then and the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
p00225_A,00225,A,and that s the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself and we re like him
p00226_A,00226,A,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p00227_A,00227,A,no frau liesecke but that is because they are fresh water and different salt water ought to have tides and go up and down a great deal or else it smells look for instance at an aquarium
p00228_A,00228,A,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p00229_A,00229,A,yes that is so
p00230_A,00230,A,i hope she hasn t been hasty
p00231_A,00231,A,but sister to that paul
p00232_A,00232,A,i had too much to do dear to look at it i had everything to settle and explain and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides it isn t likely i should remember much i just remember having lunch in your bedroom
p00233_A,00233,A,the great wilcox peril will never return if i m certain of anything it s of that
p00234_A,00234,A,one is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions
p00235_A,00235,A,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p00236_A,00236,A,not exactly
p00237_A,00237,A,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p00238_A,00238,A,wait one minute
p00239_A,00239,A,but you ve never conceivably you ve never
p00240_A,00240,A,panic and emptiness don t
p00241_A,00241,A,here we all are
p00242_A,00242,A,here we are good morning helen
p00243_A,00243,A,good morning mr wilcox
p00244_A,00244,A,not a bad business
p00245_A,00245,A,no my letter s about howards end bryce has been ordered abroad and wants to sublet it i am far from sure that i shall give him permission there was no clause in the agreement in my opinion subletting is a mistake if he can find me another tenant whom i consider suitable i may cancel the agreement morning schlegel don t you think that s better than subletting
p00246_A,00246,A,it s all right dempster s bank s better
p00247_A,00247,A,no the fellow needn t
p00248_A,00248,A,he only says reduced
p00249_A,00249,A,with a man so poor every reduction must be great i consider it a deplorable misfortune
p00250_A,00250,A,you re ridiculous helen
p00251_A,00251,A,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest
p00252_A,00252,A,because i m an old maid i can t think why i go on like this myself
p00253_A,00253,A,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down
p00254_A,00254,A,good i did the breaking of the ice
p00255_A,00255,A,perhaps
p00256_A,00256,A,one minute
p00257_A,00257,A,i shall enjoy seeing it
p00258_A,00258,A,you ll see it at its worst for bryce decamped abroad last monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him i never saw such a disgraceful mess it s unbelievable he wasn t in the house a month
p00259_A,00259,A,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce
p00260_A,00260,A,invalid type couldn t sleep
p00261_A,00261,A,poor fellow
p00262_A,00262,A,quite right
p00263_A,00263,A,dolly would have taken them but i was in fortunately
p00264_A,00264,A,what s mr bryce like
p00265_A,00265,A,now we ll be off
p00266_A,00266,A,yes but while they re learning
p00267_A,00267,A,the motor s come to stay one must get about there s a pretty church oh you aren t sharp enough well look out if the road worries you right outward at the scenery
p00268_A,00268,A,in fancy of course in fancy you had her way of walking good day
p00269_A,00269,A,it gave her quite a turn none of you girls have any nerves really of course a word from me put it all right but silly old miss avery she frightened you didn t she margaret there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds she might have said something instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on i passed her as i came in enough to make the car shy i believe miss avery goes in for being a character some old maids do it is their last resource heaven knows what she was doing in the place but that s bryce s business not mine
p00270_A,00270,A,did you take her for a spook
p00271_A,00271,A,she s just one of the crew at the farm people like that always assume things she assumed you d know who she was she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you d seen them as you came in that you d lock up the house when you d done and would bring them on down to her and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm lack of education makes people very casual hilton was full of women like miss avery once
p00272_A,00272,A,i shouldn t have disliked it perhaps
p00273_A,00273,A,i say howards end howards ended i m rather on the spot this evening eh
p00274_A,00274,A,oh mr wilcox how can you
p00275_A,00275,A,curious mounds but in with you now another time
p00276_A,00276,A,get the women out at once

p00279_A,00279,A,do please stop i want to go back please
p00280_A,00280,A,i expect a little of will be more to the point than one of us
p00281_A,00281,A,you should have thought of that sooner charles
p00282_A,00282,A,there it s only a rotten cat
p00283_A,00283,A,yes madam the girl will receive compensation for it
p00284_A,00284,A,she was a very ruda girla
p00285_A,00285,A,wouldn t you have been rude
p00286_A,00286,A,oh henry i have been so naughty we ran over a cat charles told me not to jump out but i would and look your poor meg went such a flop
p00287_A,00287,A,thinking it was a dog
p00288_A,00288,A,ah a dog s a companion a dog ll remember you
p00289_A,00289,A,not to speak about and it s my left hand

p00291_A,00291,A,burton serve tea and coffee from the sideboard
p00292_A,00292,A,why not
p00293_A,00293,A,by your leave let me pass please
p00294_A,00294,A,i m not at home yet to townees
p00295_A,00295,A,how do you do mr bast this is an odd business what view do you take of it
p00296_A,00296,A,there is mrs bast too
p00297_A,00297,A,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p00298_A,00298,A,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment
p00299_A,00299,A,that s right
p00300_A,00300,A,and went into a bank instead
p00301_A,00301,A,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p00302_A,00302,A,i hate all this
p00303_A,00303,A,i brought them i did it all
p00304_A,00304,A,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there
p00305_A,00305,A,it s work he wants can t you see
p00306_A,00306,A,you don t know what you re talking about i shall never get work now if rich people fail at one profession they can try another not i i had my groove and i ve got out of it i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that s all poetry s nothing miss schlegel one s thoughts about this and that are nothing your money too is nothing if you ll understand me i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it s all over with him i have seen it happen to others their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge it s no good it s the whole world pulling there always will be rich and poor
p00307_A,00307,A,won t you have something to eat i don t know what to do it isn t my house and though mr wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time as i say i don t know what to do but i undertake to do what i can for you helen offer them something do try a sandwich mrs bast
p00308_A,00308,A,all right i ll see him
p00309_A,00309,A,madam you will be more comfortable at the hotel
p00310_A,00310,A,ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble il est tout fait diff rent
p00311_A,00311,A,i congratulate you on your proteges
p00312_A,00312,A,you re a nice boy you are there now i love you
p00313_A,00313,A,pray don t apologise

p00315_A,00315,A,seen hen before who hasn t seen hen he s serving you like me my boys you wait still we love em
p00316_A,00316,A,no let me do that
p00317_A,00317,A,i don t expect there s much to forgive
p00318_A,00318,A,i leave you two commissions then the first concerns mr wilcox and you are to use your discretion the second concerns the money and is to be mentioned to no one and carried out literally you will send a hundred pounds on account to morrow does that seem to you so odd
p00319_A,00319,A,but she s only a farm woman
p00320_A,00320,A,yes mrs wilcox no mrs wilcox oh yes mrs wilcox auntie received your letter quite duly auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment shall i send the servant to direct you of course auntie does not generally look after your place she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional it gives her something to do she spends quite a lot of her time there my husband says to me sometimes i say yes mrs wilcox mrs wilcox could i prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake not if i cut it for you i cannot let you go on alone now don t you really mustn t i will direct you myself if it comes to that i must get my hat now mrs wilcox don t you move while i m gone
p00321_A,00321,A,madge go away
p00322_A,00322,A,auntie it s mrs wilcox
p00323_A,00323,A,your niece and i have come together
p00324_A,00324,A,madge go away this is no moment for your hat
p00325_A,00325,A,auntie gets more eccentric lately
p00326_A,00326,A,yes mrs wilcox of course
p00327_A,00327,A,i hope miss avery is not ill
p00328_A,00328,A,well if you ll excuse me perhaps i ought to be leaving you now the servants need seeing to at the farm auntie is so odd at times
p00329_A,00329,A,certainly mrs wilcox
p00330_A,00330,A,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
p00331_A,00331,A,i don t suppose i ever shall
p00332_A,00332,A,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p00333_A,00333,A,i m afraid i cannot what are the facts we are all mad more or less you know in these days
p00334_A,00334,A,the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking
p00335_A,00335,A,it s quite impossible
p00336_A,00336,A,why
p00337_A,00337,A,but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill
p00338_A,00338,A,not in that way
p00339_A,00339,A,i cannot make it out
p00340_A,00340,A,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p00341_A,00341,A,have i time
p00342_A,00342,A,yes plenty
p00343_A,00343,A,yes
p00344_A,00344,A,if we don t find her in the porch we can stroll round into the garden our object
p00345_A,00345,A,i was just saying to my wife mansbridge that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel the house as you know is my property so it should seem quite natural for us to be there the trouble is evidently nervous wouldn t you say so margaret
p00346_A,00346,A,nothing
p00347_A,00347,A,she always was highly strung a tendency to spiritualism and those things though nothing serious musical literary artistic but i should say normal a very charming girl
p00348_A,00348,A,i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish
p00349_A,00349,A,forgive me but i will not
p00350_A,00350,A,this business is as broad as it s long we had better all work together you need us mrs wilcox and we need you
p00351_A,00351,A,please lady a message
p00352_A,00352,A,yes please
p00353_A,00353,A,but i like milk why send it away

p00356_A,00356,A,mine are lop eareds
p00357_A,00357,A,but the diddums can t listen he isn t nine months old
p00358_A,00358,A,that s not what i was saying
p00359_A,00359,A,good night mrs wilcox
p00360_A,00360,A,mr schlegel doesn t know we can t know everything can we
p00361_A,00361,A,mrs wilcox i have done wrong
p00362_A,00362,A,bring me a stick get some water he s shamming of course i only used the blade here carry him out into the air
p00363_A,00363,A,i think i ll go round to the police station
p00364_A,00364,A,what for
p00365_A,00365,A,no one ever told the lad he ll have a child
p00366_A,00366,A,he didn t say madam
p00367_A,00367,A,no my dear manslaughter manslaughter charles may go to prison i dare not tell him i don t know what to do what to do i m broken i m ended
p00368_A,00368,A,i do not agree i do not
p00369_A,00369,A,yes please
p00370_A,00370,A,the conclave s breaking at last i ll go
p00371_A,00371,A,yes i did
p00372_A,00372,A,as i ve given up the outdoor life that suited me and i have come home to look after the business it s no good my settling down here it s not really the country and it s not the town
p00373_A,00373,A,of course father
p00374_A,00374,A,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p00375_A,00375,A,then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely and let everyone understand that and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise in consequence i leave my wife no money that is her own wish all that she would have had will be divided among you i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime so that you may be independent of me that is her wish too she also is giving away a great deal of money she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew down in the field is all that clear does everyone understand
p00376_A,00376,A,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included
p00377_A,00377,A,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p00378_A,00378,A,good bye mr wilcox it does seem curious that mrs wilcox should have left margaret howards end and yet she get it after all

p00010_B,00010,B,it was over at once
p00011_B,00011,B,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
p00012_B,00012,B,now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing
p00013_B,00013,B,on the drum aunt juley
p00014_B,00014,B,no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back
p00015_B,00015,B,margaret is helen all right
p00016_B,00016,B,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p00017_B,00017,B,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p00018_B,00018,B,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p00019_B,00019,B,oh good gracious me i am so sorry tibby run after helen
p00020_B,00020,B,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do

p00022_B,00022,B,my sister is so careless
p00023_B,00023,B,not at all
p00024_B,00024,B,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p00025_B,00025,B,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p00026_B,00026,B,oh what a bother what a family we are fr frieda but it s the number they want in finsbury circus

p00032_B,00032,B,don t you talk meg you stole an old gentleman s silk top hat yes she did aunt juley it is a positive fact she thought it was a muff oh heavens i ve knocked the in and out card down where s frieda tibby why don t you ever no i can t remember what i was going to say that wasn t it but do tell the maids to hurry tea up what about this umbrella no it s all gone along the seams it s an appalling umbrella it must be mine
p00033_B,00033,B,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been
p00034_B,00034,B,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p00035_B,00035,B,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p00036_B,00036,B,i remember something of the sort now
p00037_B,00037,B,it was lucky that your father married a wife with money
p00038_B,00038,B,no i agree with aunt juley i d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts there are limits
p00039_B,00039,B,why didn t you make that young man welcome tibby you must do the host a little you know you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
p00040_B,00040,B,leave tibby alone
p00041_B,00041,B,here s the house a regular hen coop
p00042_B,00042,B,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p00043_B,00043,B,yes but it s the wrong sort of men helen means
p00044_B,00044,B,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p00045_B,00045,B,who are the w s
p00046_B,00046,B,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p00047_B,00047,B,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p00048_B,00048,B,that house being the w s house i presume
p00049_B,00049,B,you re not going to be told about the w s my child so don t you think it and on the other hand i don t the least mind if you find out so don t you think you ve done anything clever in either case give me a cigarette
p00050_B,00050,B,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke
p00051_B,00051,B,what ho
p00052_B,00052,B,oh but helen isn t a girl with no interests she has plenty of other things and other people to think about she made a false start with the wilcoxes and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them
p00053_B,00053,B,nothing
p00054_B,00054,B,it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons where the plants are in the balcony what helen you don t mind them coming do you
p00055_B,00055,B,i m not grave
p00056_B,00056,B,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p00057_B,00057,B,hark i hear bruno entering the hall
p00058_B,00058,B,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p00059_B,00059,B,go helen
p00060_B,00060,B,helen cannot deceive me she does mind
p00061_B,00061,B,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome
p00062_B,00062,B,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p00063_B,00063,B,most certainly her love has died
p00064_B,00064,B,most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
p00065_B,00065,B,oh boo hoo boo hoo hoo meg s going to return the call and i can t cos why cos i m going to german eye
p00066_B,00066,B,it is all right she does not love the young man he has not been worthy of her
p00067_B,00067,B,yes i know thanks very much
p00068_B,00068,B,i hope that your sister is safe in germany by now
p00069_B,00069,B,yes thank you i heard on tuesday only on tuesday for they live right away at stettin did you ever know any one living at stettin
p00070_B,00070,B,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
p00071_B,00071,B,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly
p00072_B,00072,B,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly
p00073_B,00073,B,you will admit though that the continent it seems silly to speak of the continent but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england england is unique do have another jelly first i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs
p00074_B,00074,B,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end
p00075_B,00075,B,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p00076_B,00076,B,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p00077_B,00077,B,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p00078_B,00078,B,oh but come upstairs for a little miss quested plays do you like macdowell do you mind his only having two noises if you must really go i ll see you out won t you even have coffee
p00079_B,00079,B,what an interesting life you all lead in london
p00080_B,00080,B,but couldn t you get it renewed
p00081_B,00081,B,i beg your pardon
p00082_B,00082,B,a thousand thanks miss schlegel for all your help
p00083_B,00083,B,not at all
p00084_B,00084,B,oh henry dear here s a lovely surprise but let me introduce but i think you know miss schlegel
p00085_B,00085,B,another day mrs wilcox of course
p00086_B,00086,B,cart and car being practically at right angles
p00087_B,00087,B,henry why do people who have enough money try to get more money i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet there would be no more wars a more inward light not so much for myself as for baby
p00088_B,00088,B,why didn t you tell me you knew of it
p00089_B,00089,B,thanks put it down
p00090_B,00090,B,he s going to read his letters first i think i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday
p00091_B,00091,B,thank you evie dear charles
p00092_B,00092,B,yes dear
p00093_B,00093,B,yes rather you must complain to chalkeley
p00094_B,00094,B,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p00095_B,00095,B,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p00096_B,00096,B,wait dear wait a minute who had the key of the garage while you were away crane
p00097_B,00097,B,the gardener sir
p00098_B,00098,B,she wants howards end
p00099_B,00099,B,no sir
p00100_B,00100,B,but you haven t listened charles
p00101_B,00101,B,schlegels again
p00102_B,00102,B,oh no the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her
p00103_B,00103,B,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this
p00104_B,00104,B,but i say that note isn t legal houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
p00105_B,00105,B,give it her
p00106_B,00106,B,the question is the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly
p00107_B,00107,B,why you just said it was
p00108_B,00108,B,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible
p00109_B,00109,B,mother couldn t have meant it
p00110_B,00110,B,that time may prove
p00111_B,00111,B,how
p00112_B,00112,B,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p00113_B,00113,B,i wish she would i could then deal with her
p00114_B,00114,B,so could i i could deal with her if she comes but she won t come you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel
p00115_B,00115,B,but those chrysanthemums
p00116_B,00116,B,or coming down to the funeral at all
p00117_B,00117,B,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p00118_B,00118,B,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p00119_B,00119,B,she s a cosmopolitan i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans my fault doubtless i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit i think that s about all isn t it i want to run down and see chalkeley a bicycle will do and by the way i wish you d speak to crane some time i m certain he s had my new car out
p00120_B,00120,B,has he done it any harm
p00121_B,00121,B,i was thinking of mr vyse he never strikes me as particularly happy
p00122_B,00122,B,ye es
p00123_B,00123,B,i hope you were pleased
p00124_B,00124,B,but how on earth
p00125_B,00125,B,no i can t say i do
p00126_B,00126,B,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially
p00127_B,00127,B,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
p00128_B,00128,B,the mistake arose out of my card did it
p00129_B,00129,B,then why
p00130_B,00130,B,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p00131_B,00131,B,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p00132_B,00132,B,oh don t let us mind
p00133_B,00133,B,no doubt it s another beautiful book but i d rather hear about your road
p00134_B,00134,B,where did you start from do tell us more
p00135_B,00135,B,yes go on
p00136_B,00136,B,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p00137_B,00137,B,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses besides they can t walk it tires them go on
p00138_B,00138,B,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus
p00139_B,00139,B,heavens no
p00140_B,00140,B,heaven help us if we do
p00141_B,00141,B,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p00142_B,00142,B,you ve not been content to dream as we have
p00143_B,00143,B,no i shall not it s better like this
p00144_B,00144,B,that s rather a sad view of life surely
p00145_B,00145,B,yes don t you wish you knew what that card was
p00146_B,00146,B,well i know where you ve been but you don t know where i ve been
p00147_B,00147,B,but that would be pauperising them
p00148_B,00148,B,no
p00149_B,00149,B,ugh
p00150_B,00150,B,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p00151_B,00151,B,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
p00152_B,00152,B,not at all i don t agree with your sister there s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster it would have helped me no end
p00153_B,00153,B,but this is going to be far better than the debate itself
p00154_B,00154,B,no i won t go on i ll just put our special case to mr wilcox
p00155_B,00155,B,what s his profession
p00156_B,00156,B,porphyrion fire insurance company
p00157_B,00157,B,my dear miss schlegel i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested my only contribution is this let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed
p00158_B,00158,B,why
p00159_B,00159,B,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p00160_B,00160,B,and how does he clean the boots
p00161_B,00161,B,not well
p00162_B,00162,B,i thought an insurance company never smashed don t the others always run in and save them
p00163_B,00163,B,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love
p00164_B,00164,B,and how s howards end looking
p00165_B,00165,B,and mine
p00166_B,00166,B,you too on the move
p00167_B,00167,B,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p00168_B,00168,B,do yes that s worth doing let us
p00169_B,00169,B,sugar
p00170_B,00170,B,cake the big cake or the little deadlies i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we ll explain we aren t odd really nor affected really we re over expressive that s all
p00171_B,00171,B,the more a lady has to say the better
p00172_B,00172,B,how do you like your work
p00173_B,00173,B,oh well enough
p00174_B,00174,B,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p00175_B,00175,B,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
p00176_B,00176,B,it depends on what you call big
p00177_B,00177,B,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p00178_B,00178,B,you can tell your friend that he s quite wrong
p00179_B,00179,B,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p00180_B,00180,B,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p00181_B,00181,B,so you like carlyle
p00182_B,00182,B,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p00183_B,00183,B,i bred em myself
p00184_B,00184,B,oh really mr bast come and play with puppies
p00185_B,00185,B,i ve got to be going now
p00186_B,00186,B,this is ahab that s jezebel
p00187_B,00187,B,i ve got to be going
p00188_B,00188,B,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p00189_B,00189,B,come again
p00190_B,00190,B,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure
p00191_B,00191,B,are we intruding miss schlegel can we be of any use or shall we go
p00192_B,00192,B,you you you you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star you saw the sunrise you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all away past books and houses to the truth you were looking for a real home
p00193_B,00193,B,can i help you now may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
p00194_B,00194,B,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand
p00195_B,00195,B,i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves i didn t interfere you were splendid miss schlegel absolutely splendid you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
p00196_B,00196,B,oh yes
p00197_B,00197,B,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me
p00198_B,00198,B,yes indeed all that part about mechanical cheerfulness oh fine
p00199_B,00199,B,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you
p00200_B,00200,B,yes indeed
p00201_B,00201,B,ye es
p00202_B,00202,B,naughty young man
p00203_B,00203,B,he has apparently got them
p00204_B,00204,B,yes indeed father
p00205_B,00205,B,he was tramping in surrey if you mean that
p00206_B,00206,B,m m m m
p00207_B,00207,B,he s very clever isn t he
p00208_B,00208,B,she is very young to undertake this sort of thing
p00209_B,00209,B,helen s right enough but i can t stand the toothy one and i shouldn t have called either of them girls
p00210_B,00210,B,i thought i d get round if i could evie told me of her little plan so i just slipped in and secured a table always secure a table first evie don t pretend you want to sit by your old father because you don t miss schlegel come in my side out of pity my goodness but you look tired been worrying round after your young clerks
p00211_B,00211,B,i want a new home in september and some one must find it i can t
p00212_B,00212,B,i can t say i do
p00213_B,00213,B,next time you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles s
p00214_B,00214,B,with pleasure
p00215_B,00215,B,i needn t but hadn t i better it s really getting rather serious we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street we don t know what we want that s the mischief with us
p00216_B,00216,B,no we have no real ties
p00217_B,00217,B,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p00218_B,00218,B,who are the wilcoxes
p00219_B,00219,B,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p00220_B,00220,B,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
p00221_B,00221,B,interesting people don t get one houses
p00222_B,00222,B,your father may have been able to change countries and that may or may not be a good thing but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
p00223_B,00223,B,i knew it i told you so it is the little things one bungles at the big real ones are nothing when they come
p00224_B,00224,B,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p00225_B,00225,B,helen may be right
p00226_B,00226,B,of course she s right
p00227_B,00227,B,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p00228_B,00228,B,there always has been mud in poole harbour the rivers bring it down and a most valuable oyster fishery depends upon it
p00229_B,00229,B,aunt juley wouldn t that be meg s train

p00235_B,00235,B,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p00236_B,00236,B,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you

p00244_B,00244,B,when there is a sublet i find that damage
p00245_B,00245,B,do excuse me but about the porphyrion i don t feel easy might i just bother you henry you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out he writes this morning that he s taken our advice and now you say it s not a bad concern
p00246_B,00246,B,did i it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies lately it came in safe as houses now
p00247_B,00247,B,he only says reduced

p00256_B,00256,B,i shall enjoy seeing it
p00257_B,00257,B,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce

p00259_B,00259,B,invalid type couldn t sleep
p00260_B,00260,B,poor fiddlesticks he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave charles flung them down
p00261_B,00261,B,yes i flung them down
p00262_B,00262,B,what s mr bryce like

p00264_B,00264,B,they re all right they ll learn like the swallows and the telegraph wires
p00265_B,00265,B,yes but while they re learning

p00293_B,00293,B,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home
p00294_B,00294,B,what is it oh what s wrong is tibby ill

p00296_B,00296,B,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p00297_B,00297,B,i don t understand you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn t you
p00298_B,00298,B,that s right
p00299_B,00299,B,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame

p00301_B,00301,B,i hope you do mr bast but it s no good mincing matters you have done yourself no good by coming here if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake

p00303_B,00303,B,that isn t what i want miss schlegel you re very kind and no doubt it s a false position but you make me miserable i seem no good at all

p00308_B,00308,B,i should be glad if you took him but i don t know whether he s qualified

p00316_B,00316,B,i don t expect there s much to forgive
p00317_B,00317,B,you put it with your usual delicacy
p00318_B,00318,B,yes
p00319_B,00319,B,left to itself this county would vote liberal
p00320_B,00320,B,are you sure that miss avery is up here
p00321_B,00321,B,your niece and i have come together
p00322_B,00322,B,madge go away this is no moment for your hat
p00323_B,00323,B,auntie gets more eccentric lately
p00324_B,00324,B,miss avery i have come about the furniture could you kindly let me in
p00325_B,00325,B,yes mrs wilcox of course
p00326_B,00326,B,well if you ll excuse me perhaps i ought to be leaving you now the servants need seeing to at the farm auntie is so odd at times
p00327_B,00327,B,well come right in mrs wilcox
p00328_B,00328,B,thank you so much
p00329_B,00329,B,helen won t be able to stop aunt juley she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you she must go back to germany as soon as you are well
p00330_B,00330,B,all the same you have not quite seen our point
p00331_B,00331,B,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p00332_B,00332,B,the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking
p00333_B,00333,B,she has never behaved like this before then
p00334_B,00334,B,of course not
p00335_B,00335,B,it doesn t seem impossible to me it is surely a very tippy plan
p00336_B,00336,B,it is impossible because it s not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning it would do splendidly for other people whom i don t blame
p00337_B,00337,B,i see you have scruples
p00338_B,00338,B,pater we may as well keep howards end out of it
p00339_B,00339,B,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p00340_B,00340,B,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off
p00341_B,00341,B,dolly i m going without her tell her i thought it best
p00342_B,00342,B,yes mr wilcox i see
p00343_B,00343,B,i was just saying to my wife mansbridge that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel the house as you know is my property so it should seem quite natural for us to be there the trouble is evidently nervous wouldn t you say so margaret
p00344_B,00344,B,nothing
p00345_B,00345,B,though she did resent my husband s immorality
p00346_B,00346,B,she always was highly strung a tendency to spiritualism and those things though nothing serious musical literary artistic but i should say normal a very charming girl
p00347_B,00347,B,oh my darling yes all right
p00348_B,00348,B,come come margaret this is a terrible business an appalling business it s doctor s orders open the door
p00349_B,00349,B,this business is as broad as it s long we had better all work together you need us mrs wilcox and we need you
p00350_B,00350,B,i do not need you in the least no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement
p00351_B,00351,B,this is mr wilcox s house
p00352_B,00352,B,but i like milk why send it away
p00353_B,00353,B,please i m to call in the morning for the can
p00354_B,00354,B,nice little boy i say what s your name mine s helen
p00355_B,00355,B,tom
p00356_B,00356,B,undoubtedly he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful but this place has wonderful powers
p00357_B,00357,B,is it what we feared
p00358_B,00358,B,it is
p00359_B,00359,B,why should miss avery work for us
p00360_B,00360,B,i say jacky i m going out for a bit
p00361_B,00361,B,that s enough
p00362_B,00362,B,yes murder s enough
p00363_B,00363,B,very well sir which car will you have
p00364_B,00364,B,i think i ll walk
p00365_B,00365,B,is it the keys that mr wilcox wants
p00366_B,00366,B,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message
p00367_B,00367,B,what was that
p00368_B,00368,B,tommy
p00369_B,00369,B,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him
p00370_B,00370,B,yes i did
p00371_B,00371,B,it s apparently got to suit us
p00372_B,00372,B,of course father
p00373_B,00373,B,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p00374_B,00374,B,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included
p00375_B,00375,B,don t paul you promised you d take care
p00376_B,00376,B,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p00377_B,00377,B,good bye mr wilcox it does seem curious that mrs wilcox should have left margaret howards end and yet she get it after all
p00378_B,00378,B,good bye
p00379_B,00379,B,good bye dolly
p00380_B,00380,B,so long father
p00381_B,00381,B,good bye
p00382_B,00382,B,could you tell me henry what was that about mrs wilcox having left me howards end
p00383_B,00383,B,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i
