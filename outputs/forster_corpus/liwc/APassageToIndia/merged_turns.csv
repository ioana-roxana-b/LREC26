1046,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],may i now take my leave now i take my leave i must tell you how glad i am to hear that after all you succeeded in reaching the marabar i feared my unpunctuality had prevented you but you went a far pleasanter method in miss derek s car i hope the expedition was a successful one,1173,1173,Q1173
1047,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],the news has not reached you yet i can see,1174,1174,Q1174
1048,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],oh yes,1175,1175,Q1175
1049,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz,1176,1176,Q1176
1050,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],oh yes that is all round the college,1177,1177,Q1177
1051,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one,1178,1178,Q1178
1052,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],i cannot say i was not present,1179,1179,Q1179
1053,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],i am most frightfully cut up,1180,1180,Q1180
1054,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know,1181,1181,Q1181
1055,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],yes alas,1182,1182,Q1182
1056,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school,1183,1186,"Q1183,Q1184,Q1185,Q1186"
1057,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],a name a name for a school,1187,1187,Q1187
1058,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known,1188,1188,Q1188
1059,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison,1189,1189,Q1189
1060,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth,1190,1190,Q1190
1061,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],godbole is aziz innocent or guilty,1191,1192,"Q1191,Q1192"
1062,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt,1193,1193,Q1193
1063,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing,1194,1194,Q1194
1064,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us,1195,1195,Q1195
1065,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same,1196,1196,Q1196
1066,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs,1197,1202,"Q1197,Q1198,Q1199,Q1200,Q1201,Q1202"
1067,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something,1203,1203,Q1203
1068,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both,1204,1204,Q1204
1069,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],you re preaching that evil and good are the same,1205,1205,Q1205
1070,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding'],oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground,1206,1208,"Q1206,Q1207,Q1208"
1071,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole'],yes yes,1209,1209,Q1209

1441,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair,1618,1618,Q1618
1442,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],would it not interest you to hear my side,1619,1619,Q1619
1443,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],not much,1620,1620,Q1620
1444,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it,1621,1621,Q1621
1445,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],what kind of illness that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination,1622,1623,"Q1622,Q1623"
1446,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps,1624,1626,"Q1624,Q1625,Q1626"
1447,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],can you remember when you first felt out of sorts,1627,1627,Q1627
1448,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],when i came to tea with you there in that garden house,1628,1628,Q1628
1449,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too,1629,1629,Q1629
1450,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made,1630,1630,Q1630
1451,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],you put it honestly anyhow,1631,1631,Q1631
1452,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere,1632,1632,Q1632
1453,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],it ll get us to heaven,1633,1633,Q1633
1454,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],will it,1634,1634,Q1634
1455,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],if heaven existed,1635,1635,Q1635
1456,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask,1636,1636,Q1636
1457,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i do not yet i believe that honesty gets us there,1637,1637,Q1637
1458,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],how can that be,1638,1638,Q1638
1459,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down,1639,1640,"Q1639,Q1640"
1460,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost,1641,1641,Q1641
1461,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i don t go to that length,1642,1642,Q1642
1462,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does,1643,1643,Q1643
1463,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],she s an old lady,1644,1644,Q1644
1464,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son,1645,1645,Q1645
1465,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter,1646,1646,Q1646
1466,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],because the dead don t live again,1647,1647,Q1647
1467,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i fear not,1648,1648,Q1648
1468,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],so do i what does dr aziz say of me,1649,1650,"Q1649,Q1650"
1469,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else,1651,1652,"Q1651,Q1652"
1470,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],the guide,1653,1653,Q1653
1471,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them,1654,1654,Q1654
1472,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],perhaps it was the guide,1655,1655,Q1655
1473,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district,1656,1656,Q1656
1474,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],someone who was in another cave and followed me when the guide was looking away possibly,1657,1657,Q1657
1475,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",hullo my dear fielding so i run you down at last can you come out at once to dilkusha,1658,1658,Q1658
1476,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",at once,1659,1659,Q1659
1477,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt,1660,1660,Q1660
1478,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends,1661,1661,Q1661
1479,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous,1662,1662,Q1662
1480,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning,1663,1663,Q1663
1481,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say,1664,1664,Q1664
1482,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to,1665,1665,Q1665
1483,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves,1666,1667,"Q1666,Q1667"
1484,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",not at all we were only discussing possibilities,1668,1668,Q1668
1485,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by,1669,1670,"Q1669,Q1670"
1486,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",gladly in a minute,1671,1671,Q1671
1487,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow,1672,1672,Q1672
1488,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",not the turtons i thought you were their guest,1673,1673,Q1673
1489,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience,1674,1674,Q1674
1490,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow,1675,1675,Q1675
1491,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",they might equally attack the dak bungalow,1676,1676,Q1676
1492,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours,1677,1677,Q1677
1493,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",quite so i have given trouble enough,1678,1678,Q1678
1494,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him,1679,1679,Q1679
1495,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow,1680,1680,Q1680
1496,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",then where is she to go we shall never have done with her,1681,1681,Q1681
1497,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested,1682,1682,Q1682
1498,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again,1683,1683,Q1683
1499,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman,1684,1684,Q1684
1500,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now,1685,1685,Q1685

1507,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",i ll see him first if you prefer,1692,1692,Q1692
1508,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate,1693,1693,Q1693
1509,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']",he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in,1694,1694,Q1694
1510,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",does he tell me to come out to him,1695,1695,Q1695
1511,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']",whether he tells you or not you will go i think,1696,1696,Q1696
1512,Adela Quested,"['Cyril Fielding', 'Hamidullah']",perfectly right,1697,1697,Q1697
1513,Cyril Fielding,['Hamidullah'],thank goodness that s over,1698,1698,Q1698
1514,Hamidullah,['Adela Quested'],it was insulting of him not to come in,1699,1699,Q1699

1520,Hamidullah,['Cyril Fielding'],may is no month to allow an old lady to travel in,1705,1705,Q1705

1562,Cyril Fielding,['Dr. Aziz'],be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one,1751,1752,"Q1751,Q1752"

1572,Cyril Fielding,['Dr. Aziz'],let us discuss that to morrow morning,1763,1763,Q1763
1573,Dr. Aziz,['Cyril Fielding'],is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella,1764,1764,Q1764

1579,Dr. Aziz,['Cyril Fielding'],i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental,1770,1770,Q1770
1580,Cyril Fielding,['Dr. Aziz'],you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz,1771,1771,Q1771
1581,Dr. Aziz,['Cyril Fielding'],is emotion a sack of potatoes so much the pound to be measured out am i a machine i shall be told i can use up my emotions by using them next,1772,1772,Q1772
1582,Cyril Fielding,['Dr. Aziz'],i should have thought you could it sounds common sense you can t eat your cake and have it even in the world of the spirit,1773,1773,Q1773
1583,Dr. Aziz,['Cyril Fielding'],if you are right there is no point in any friendship it all comes down to give and take or give and return which is disgusting and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow so materialistic,1774,1774,Q1774
1584,Cyril Fielding,['Dr. Aziz'],your unfairness is worse than my materialism,1775,1775,Q1775
1585,Dr. Aziz,['Cyril Fielding'],i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time,1776,1777,"Q1776,Q1777"
1586,Cyril Fielding,['Dr. Aziz'],i m sorry to say mrs moore s dead,1778,1778,Q1778

1590,Lady Mellanby,[],i had only seen the poor creature for a few hours when she was taken ill really this has been needlessly distressing it spoils one s home coming,1782,1782,Q1782
1591,Mr. Mcbryde,[],there s propaganda behind all this,1783,1783,Q1783
1592,Sir Gilbert,['Cyril Fielding'],the broad the sensible the only possible charitable view from the first speaking confidentially mishandled by certain of our friends up the hill the hands of the clock move forward not back,1784,1784,Q1784
1593,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],of course i ought to have thought of it myself my instincts never help me why didn t i rush up to him after the trial yes of course i will write him an apology but please will you dictate it shall i write another nothing matters if i can undo the harm i have caused i can do this right and that right but when the two are put together they come wrong that s the defect of my character i have never realized it until now i thought that if i was just and asked questions i would come through every difficulty,1785,1786,"Q1785,Q1786"
1594,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand,1787,1787,Q1787
1595,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],do i like anyone though,1788,1788,Q1788
1596,_unknowable,['Cyril Fielding'],mr fielding we must all be educated promptly,1789,1789,Q1789

1599,Dr. Aziz,['Cyril Fielding'],i see your trick i want revenge on them why should i be insulted and suffer and the contents of my pockets read and my wife s photograph taken to the police station also i want the money to educate my little boys as i explained to her,1793,1793,Q1793
1600,_unknowable,[],that marabar case which broke down because the poor girl couldn t face giving her evidence that was another bad case,1794,1794,Q1794
1601,Ronny Heaslop,['Cyril Fielding'],i wish to thank you for the help you have given miss quested she will not of course trespass on your hospitality further she has as a matter of fact decided to return to england i have just arranged about her passage for her i understand she would like to see you,1795,1795,Q1795
1602,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i shall go round at once,1796,1796,Q1796
1603,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced,1797,1798,"Q1797,Q1798"
1604,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical,1799,1799,Q1799
1605,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of,1800,1800,Q1800
1606,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i no longer want love,1801,1801,Q1801
1607,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it,1802,1802,Q1802
1608,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],but to go back to our first talk for i suppose this is our last one when you entered that cave who did follow you or did no one follow you can you now say i don t like it left in air,1803,1803,Q1803
1609,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know,1804,1804,Q1804
1610,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],how could she have known what we don t,1805,1805,Q1805

1614,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am,1809,1809,Q1809
1615,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],of course this death has been troubling me,1810,1810,Q1810
1616,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],aziz was so fond of her too,1811,1811,Q1811
1617,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real,1812,1812,Q1812
1618,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested'],don t let it become too real or you ll die yourself that is the objection to meditating upon death we are subdued to what we work in i have felt the same temptation and had to sheer off i want to go on living a bit,1813,1813,Q1813
1619,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],so do i,1814,1814,Q1814

1625,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding'],oh that would be very nice,1820,1820,Q1820
1626,The Missionary,['Adela Quested'],to what duties miss quested are you returning in your own country after your taste of the tropics observe i don t say to what do you turn but to what do you re turn every life ought to contain both a turn and a re turn this celebrated pioneer will make my question clear he turns to the east he re turns to the west you can see it from the cute position of his hands one of which holds a string of sausages,1821,1822,"Q1821,Q1822"
1627,Adela Quested,['The Missionary'],i see,1823,1823,Q1823

1632,Dr. Aziz,['Mr. Das'],i know but will it last,1828,1828,Q1828
1633,Mr. Das,['Dr. Aziz'],i fear not and for that reason if i may say so do not introduce too many persian expressions into the poem and not too much about the bulbul,1829,1829,Q1829
1634,Dr. Aziz,['Mr. Das'],half a sec here you are is not this better than a poem,1830,1830,Q1830

1636,Dr. Aziz,['Mr. Das'],you are full of compliments to day,1832,1832,Q1832

1646,Dr. Aziz,['Hamidullah'],my great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke,1843,1843,Q1843
1647,Hamidullah,['Dr. Aziz'],it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand,1844,1844,Q1844

1653,Hamidullah,['Dr. Aziz'],oh that is going much too far,1851,1851,Q1851
