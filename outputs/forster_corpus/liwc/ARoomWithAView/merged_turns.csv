42,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Bartlett']",he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth,49,49,Q49
43,Lucy,"['Miss Bartlett', 'Mr. Beebe']",i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice,50,50,Q50
44,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Bartlett']",i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it,51,51,Q51
45,Miss Bartlett,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']",am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too,52,53,"Q52,Q53"

119,George Emerson,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Emerson']",remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels,140,140,Q140
120,Mr. Emerson,"['George Emerson', 'Lucy']",no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no,141,142,"Q141,Q142"

144,Mr. Emerson,['Lucy'],how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is,167,170,"Q167,Q168,Q169,Q170"

180,The Chambermaid,['Mr. Beebe'],fa niente sono vecchia,209,209,Q209
181,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Catherine Alan']",i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe,210,211,"Q210,Q211"
182,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']",oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable,212,212,Q212
183,Lucy,"['Miss Catherine Alan', 'Mr. Beebe']",what was that,213,213,Q213
184,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']",it was a novel and i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink she said but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour this novel is to be about modern italy the other was historical but that she could not start till she had an idea first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came here this must on no account get round and so cheerful through it all i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them all the same she is a little too i hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived i don t know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely,214,216,"Q214,Q215,Q216"
185,Miss Catherine Alan,['Lucy'],stomach he warned miss pole of her stomach acidity he called it and he may have meant to be kind i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought she thought they were commercial travellers was the word she used and all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson then miss lavish said just imagine tut the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak i said it was horrible speaking i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice the woman i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place but that was not all after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers,217,217,Q217
186,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Catherine Alan']",let me finish the story miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said she went at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience,218,220,"Q218,Q219,Q220"
187,Lucy,"['Miss Catherine Alan', 'Mr. Beebe']",whatever happened,221,221,Q221
188,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Catherine Alan']",no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling,222,222,Q222

512,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],at present,604,604,Q604
513,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad,605,605,Q605
514,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes,606,606,Q606
515,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be,607,607,Q607
516,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],in what way,608,608,Q608
517,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks,609,609,Q609
518,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],but the string never broke,610,610,Q610

521,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],broken what do you mean,613,613,Q613
522,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],i meant that she is going to marry me,614,614,Q614
523,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me,615,615,Q615
524,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval,616,616,Q616
525,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you,617,617,Q617
526,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe'],you are conscious of having said something indiscreet,618,618,Q618
527,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil'],no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her,619,621,"Q619,Q620,Q621"
