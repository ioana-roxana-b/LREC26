16,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether i have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars if you are i will begin directly,17,17,Q17
17,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],you need not give yourself that trouble sir,18,18,Q18
18,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],no trouble i assure you madam have you been long in bath madam,19,19,Q19

20,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],really,21,21,Q21
21,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],why should you be surprised sir,22,22,Q22
22,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam,23,23,Q23
23,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],never sir,24,24,Q24
24,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms,25,25,Q25
25,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes sir i was there last monday,26,26,Q26
26,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],have you been to the theatre,27,27,Q27

30,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and are you altogether pleased with bath,31,31,Q31
31,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes i like it very well,32,32,Q32
32,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow,33,34,"Q33,Q34"
33,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],my journal,35,35,Q35
34,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense,36,36,Q36
35,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],indeed i shall say no such thing,37,37,Q37
36,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],shall i tell you what you ought to say,38,38,Q38
37,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],if you please,39,39,Q39
38,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say,40,40,Q40
39,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but perhaps i keep no journal,41,41,Q41
40,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,42,42,Q42
41,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side,43,43,Q43
42,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars,44,44,Q44
43,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],and what are they,45,45,Q45
44,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar,46,46,Q46
45,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way,47,47,Q47
46,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes,48,48,Q48
47,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",my dear catherine do take this pin out of my sleeve i am afraid it has torn a hole already i shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard,49,49,Q49
48,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam,50,50,Q50
49,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",do you understand muslins sir,51,51,Q51
50,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin,52,52,Q52
51,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",men commonly take so little notice of those things i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir,53,53,Q53
52,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",i hope i am madam,54,54,Q54
53,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown,55,55,Q55
54,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray,56,56,Q56
55,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']",how can you be so,57,57,Q57
56,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it,58,58,Q58
57,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces,59,59,Q59
58,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes,60,60,Q60
59,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory,61,61,Q61
60,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i was not thinking of anything,62,62,Q62
61,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me,63,63,Q63
62,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],well then i will not,64,64,Q64
63,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much,65,65,Q65
64,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],what a delightful place bath is and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here,66,66,Q66
65,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",i think madam i cannot be mistaken it is a long time since i had the pleasure of seeing you but is not your name allen here come my dear girls my dear mrs allen i long to introduce them they will be so delighted to see you the tallest is isabella my eldest is not she a fine young woman the others are very much admired too but i believe isabella is the handsomest,67,68,"Q67,Q68"

67,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'Mrs. Allen']",the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister,70,70,Q70

71,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho,74,74,Q74
72,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil,75,75,Q75
73,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know,76,76,Q76
74,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world,77,77,Q77
75,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you,78,78,Q78
76,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],have you indeed how glad i am what are they all,79,79,Q79
77,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time,80,80,Q80
78,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid,81,81,Q81
79,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it,82,82,Q82
80,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],scold them do you scold them for not admiring her,83,83,Q83
81,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men,84,84,Q84
82,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],oh dear how can you say so,85,85,Q85
83,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings,86,88,"Q86,Q87,Q88"
84,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again,89,89,Q89
85,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so,90,90,Q90
86,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it,91,91,Q91
87,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels,92,92,Q92
88,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way,93,93,Q93
89,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume,94,94,Q94
90,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining,95,95,Q95
91,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know,96,96,Q96
92,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but it does not signify if they do,97,97,Q97
93,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance,98,98,Q98
94,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me,99,99,Q99
95,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair,100,100,Q100
96,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark,101,101,Q101
97,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description,102,102,Q102
98,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],betray you what do you mean,103,103,Q103
99,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up and which way are they gone one was a very good looking young man,104,107,"Q104,Q105,Q106,Q107"
100,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],they went towards the church yard,108,108,Q108

102,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],only perhaps we may overtake the two young men,110,110,Q110
103,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat,111,111,Q111
104,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all,112,112,Q112
105,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect that is the way to spoil them oh these odious gigs how i detest them delightful mr morland and my brother,113,115,"Q113,Q114,Q115"

264,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours,283,283,Q283
265,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but they are such very different things,284,284,Q284
266,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],that you think they cannot be compared together,285,285,Q285
267,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour,286,286,Q286
268,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,287,287,Q287
269,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them,288,288,Q288
270,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,289,289,Q289
271,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no indeed i never thought of that,290,290,Q290
272,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose,291,291,Q291
273,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with,292,292,Q292
274,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and is that to be my only security alas alas,293,293,Q293
275,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody,294,294,Q294
276,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before,295,295,Q295
277,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes quite more so indeed,296,296,Q296
278,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks,297,297,Q297
279,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months,298,298,Q298
280,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer,299,299,Q299
281,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there,300,300,Q300
282,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],you are not fond of the country,301,301,Q301
283,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another,302,302,Q302
284,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country,303,303,Q303
285,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],do i,304,304,Q304
286,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],do you not,305,305,Q305
287,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i do not believe there is much difference,306,306,Q306
288,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long,307,307,Q307
289,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen,308,308,Q308
290,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here,309,309,Q309
291,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath,310,310,Q310
292,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father,311,312,"Q311,Q312"
293,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh,313,313,Q313
294,Catherine Morland,[],how handsome a family they are,314,314,Q314
295,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i shall like it beyond anything in the world and do not let us put it off let us go tomorrow,315,315,Q315
296,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],remember twelve o clock,316,316,Q316
297,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],oh dear i do believe it will be wet,317,317,Q317
298,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],i thought how it would be,318,318,Q318
299,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],no walk for me today but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve,319,319,Q319
300,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty,320,320,Q320
301,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],oh that will not signify i never mind dirt,321,321,Q321
302,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],no i know you never mind dirt,322,322,Q322
303,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],it comes on faster and faster,323,323,Q323
304,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet,324,324,Q324
305,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella,325,325,Q325
306,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time,326,326,Q326
307,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry,327,327,Q327
308,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable you will not be able to go my dear,328,329,"Q328,Q329"
309,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i shall give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather,330,330,Q330
310,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland'],always thought it would clear up,331,331,Q331
311,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen'],isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare they are coming for me perhaps but i shall not go i cannot go indeed for you know miss tilney may still call,332,332,Q332

315,James Morland,"['Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe', 'Mrs. Allen']",i doubt our being able to do so much,336,336,Q336

366,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible,392,392,Q392

391,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'James Morland']",i suspect there is no great struggle,418,418,Q418

393,Catherine Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'James Morland', 'John Thorpe']",you have not,420,420,Q420
394,John Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'James Morland']",i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey,421,421,Q421
395,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'James Morland', 'John Thorpe']",a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party,422,422,Q422
396,Catherine Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'James Morland', 'John Thorpe']",this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it,423,425,"Q423,Q424,Q425"
397,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']",let her go let her go if she will go,426,426,Q426
398,John Thorpe,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'James Morland']",she is as obstinate as,427,427,Q427
399,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i am come in a great hurry it was all a mistake i never promised to go i told them from the first i could not go i ran away in a great hurry to explain it i did not care what you thought of me i would not stay for the servant,428,428,Q428
400,Mr. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",well and do you think of going too,429,429,Q429
401,Catherine Morland,"['Mr. Allen', 'Mrs. Allen']",no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i,430,430,Q430
402,Mr. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable,431,431,Q431
403,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']",yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself,432,432,Q432
404,Mr. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related,433,433,Q433
405,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']",yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it,434,434,Q434
406,Catherine Morland,"['Mr. Allen', 'Mrs. Allen']",dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong,435,435,Q435
407,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']",and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted,436,436,Q436
408,Catherine Morland,"['Mr. Allen', 'Mrs. Allen']",but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade,437,437,Q437
409,Mr. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more,438,438,Q438
410,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']",that is just what i was going to say,439,439,Q439
411,Mr. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Allen']",you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will,440,440,Q440
412,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i never look at it without thinking of the south of france,441,441,Q441
413,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",you have been abroad then,442,442,Q442
414,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say,443,443,Q443
415,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",why not,444,444,Q444
416,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books,445,445,Q445
417,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time,446,446,Q446
418,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it,447,447,Q447
419,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion,448,448,Q448
420,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,449,449,Q449
421,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home,450,450,Q450
422,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,451,451,Q451
423,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding,452,452,Q452
424,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way,453,453,Q453
425,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so,454,454,Q454
426,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word,455,455,Q455
427,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading,456,456,Q456
428,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",to say the truth i do not much like any other,457,457,Q457
429,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",indeed,458,458,Q458
430,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you,459,459,Q459
431,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",yes i am fond of history,460,460,Q460
432,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books,461,461,Q461
433,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great,462,462,Q462
434,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it,463,463,Q463
435,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,464,464,Q464
436,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,465,465,Q465
437,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,466,466,Q466
438,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london,467,467,Q467
439,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",indeed and of what nature,468,468,Q468
440,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet,469,469,Q469
441,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",good heaven where could you hear of such a thing,470,470,Q470
442,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind,471,471,Q471
443,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect,472,472,Q472
444,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit,473,474,"Q473,Q474"
445,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot,475,475,Q475
446,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",riot what riot,476,476,Q476
447,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general,477,477,Q477
448,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways,478,478,Q478
449,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them,479,479,Q479
450,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",no doubt but that is no explanation of the present,480,480,Q480
451,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",what am i to do,481,481,Q481
452,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women,482,482,Q482
453,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company,483,483,Q483
454,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",that is not enough be more serious,484,484,Q484
455,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half,485,485,Q485
456,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me,486,486,Q486
457,Miss Anne,['Catherine Morland'],they set off at eight this morning and i am sure i do not envy them their drive i think you and i are very well off to be out of the scrape it must be the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul at clifton at this time of year belle went with your brother and john drove maria oh yes maria is gone she was quite wild to go she thought it would be something very fine i cannot say i admire her taste and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever so much,487,488,"Q487,Q488"
458,Catherine Morland,['Miss Anne'],i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go,489,489,Q489
459,Miss Anne,['Catherine Morland'],thank you but it is quite a matter of indifference to me indeed i would not have gone on any account i was saying so to emily and sophia when you overtook us,490,490,Q490
460,Maria Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper,491,491,Q491
461,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],yes my dear catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours it sees through everything nay my beloved sweetest friend compose yourself i am amazingly agitated as you perceive let us sit down and talk in comfort well and so you guessed it the moment you had my note sly creature oh my dear catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming of men i only wish i were more worthy of him but what will your excellent father and mother say oh heavens when i think of them i am so agitated,492,493,"Q492,Q493"
462,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james,494,494,Q494
463,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own you are so like your dear brother that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with you,495,497,"Q495,Q496,Q497"
464,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],it is impossible for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately,498,498,Q498
465,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],morland says exactly the same and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody,499,499,Q499
466,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify,500,500,Q500
467,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice,501,501,Q501
468,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],i am sure they will consent i am sure they will be delighted with you,502,502,Q502
469,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],for my own part my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond,503,503,Q503
470,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us,504,504,Q504
471,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],i am sure i shall be miserable if we do not if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied but this is idle talking i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father s answer morland says that by sending it tonight to salisbury we may have it tomorrow tomorrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter i know it will be the death of me,505,505,Q505
472,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'James Morland']",indeed morland i must drive you away consider how far you have to ride i cannot bear to see you linger so for heaven s sake waste no more time there go go i insist on it,506,506,Q506

490,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters,525,525,Q525
491,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe'],perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to most matters to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about,526,526,Q526
492,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better,527,527,Q527
493,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe'],very true i think like you there if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other no matter which has it so that there is enough i hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another and to marry for money i think the wickedest thing in existence good day we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenient,528,528,Q528
494,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil,529,529,Q529
495,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day,530,530,Q530
496,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits,531,531,Q531
497,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you,532,532,Q532
498,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me,533,533,Q533
499,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart,534,534,Q534
500,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy,535,535,Q535
501,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment,536,536,Q536
502,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms,537,537,Q537
503,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],and must i go,538,538,Q538
504,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],do not you intend it i thought it was all settled,539,539,Q539
505,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself,540,540,Q540
506,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world,541,541,Q541
507,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions,542,542,Q542
508,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],why what do you mean,543,543,Q543
509,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so,544,544,Q544
510,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i do not understand you,545,545,Q545
511,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well,546,546,Q546
512,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible,547,547,Q547
513,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],bravo an excellent satire on modern language,548,548,Q548
514,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but pray tell me what you mean,549,549,Q549
515,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us,550,550,Q550
516,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no no it shall not do either i am not afraid,551,551,Q551
517,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world,552,552,Q552
518,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance,553,553,Q553
519,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and did isabella never change her mind before,554,554,Q554
520,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her,555,555,Q555
521,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself,556,556,Q556
522,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general,557,557,Q557
523,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour,558,558,Q558
524,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],i do not wonder at your surprise and i am really fatigued to death he is such a rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given the world to sit still,559,559,Q559
525,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],then why did not you,560,560,Q560
526,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us,561,561,Q561
527,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],he is very handsome indeed,562,562,Q562
528,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],handsome yes i suppose he may i dare say people would admire him in general but he is not at all in my style of beauty i hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man however he is very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know in my way,563,563,Q563
529,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Thorpe']",it is very charming indeed,564,564,Q564
530,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']",mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he can do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear,565,565,Q565
531,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Thorpe']",it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself,566,566,Q566
532,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']",i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man,567,567,Q567
533,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Thorpe']",nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money,568,568,Q568
534,Catherine Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Mrs. Thorpe']",i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford,569,569,Q569
535,Isabella Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Thorpe']",as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living,570,570,Q570
536,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']",yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection,571,571,Q571
537,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],by the end of another week,572,572,Q572
538,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home,573,573,Q573
539,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],i am very sorry for it if i had known this before,574,574,Q574
540,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],perhaps you would be so good it would make me very happy if,575,575,Q575
541,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend,576,576,Q576
542,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'General Tilney']",i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in,577,577,Q577
543,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable,578,578,Q578
544,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']",i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not,579,579,Q579
545,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world,580,580,Q580
546,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],this is my favourite place it is so out of the way,581,581,Q581
547,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here,582,582,Q582
548,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],psha my dear creature do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it,583,583,Q583
549,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming,584,584,Q584
550,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp,585,585,Q585
551,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me,586,586,Q586
552,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents,587,587,Q587
553,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],no indeed i cannot,588,588,Q588
554,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you,589,589,Q589
555,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],with me dear isabella,590,590,Q590
556,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance,591,591,Q591
557,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning,592,592,Q592
558,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],but that you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house,593,593,Q593
559,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i do remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another he is not the person my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters,594,595,"Q594,Q595"
560,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],yes yes there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so,596,597,"Q596,Q597"
561,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it,598,598,Q598
562,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last,599,599,Q599
563,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],you do acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment,600,600,Q600
564,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],oh as to that i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter,601,601,Q601
565,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe'],but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened,602,602,Q602
566,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland'],my dearest catherine i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about i do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you for people seldom know what they would be at young men especially they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant what i say is why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections and i believe he is very right ah here he comes never mind he will not see us i am sure,603,603,Q603
567,Frederick Tilney,['Isabella Thorpe'],what always to be watched in person or by proxy,604,604,Q604
568,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney'],psha nonsense why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent,605,605,Q605
569,Frederick Tilney,['Isabella Thorpe'],i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me,606,606,Q606
570,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney'],my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts,607,607,Q607
571,Frederick Tilney,['Isabella Thorpe'],if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough,608,608,Q608
572,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney'],do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you i hope your eyes are not tormented now,609,610,"Q609,Q610"
573,Frederick Tilney,['Isabella Thorpe'],never more so for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little,611,611,Q611
574,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],my brother does know it,612,612,Q612
575,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable,613,614,"Q613,Q614"
576,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i am sure my brother would not wish to do that,615,615,Q615
577,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],then you will persuade him to go away,616,616,Q616
578,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master,617,617,Q617
579,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable,618,618,Q618
580,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and are you sure it is my brother s doing,619,619,Q619
581,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes very sure,620,620,Q620
582,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain,621,621,Q621
583,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],is not it the same thing,622,622,Q622
584,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment,623,623,Q623
585,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him,624,624,Q624
586,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick,625,625,Q625
587,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another,626,626,Q626
588,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little,627,627,Q627
589,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother,628,628,Q628
590,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i can have no opinion on that subject,629,629,Q629
591,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour,630,630,Q630
592,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],you are a very close questioner,631,631,Q631
593,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],am i i only ask what i want to be told,632,632,Q632
594,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell,633,633,Q633
595,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart,634,634,Q634
596,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at,635,635,Q635
597,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],well,636,636,Q636
598,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her,637,637,Q637
599,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go,638,638,Q638
600,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month,639,640,"Q639,Q640"
601,Frederick Tilney,['Eleanor Tilney'],how glad i shall be when you are all off,641,641,Q641
602,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but how can that be are not you with her,642,642,Q642
603,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there,643,643,Q643
604,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],how sorry you must be for that,644,644,Q644
605,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i am always sorry to leave eleanor,645,645,Q645
606,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable,646,646,Q646
607,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey,647,647,Q647
608,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about,648,648,Q648
609,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry,649,649,Q649
610,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens,650,650,Q650
611,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you,651,651,Q651
612,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh but this will not happen to me i am sure,652,652,Q652
613,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock,653,653,Q653
614,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then,654,654,Q654
615,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room,655,655,Q655
616,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing,656,656,Q656
617,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness,657,657,Q657
618,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh no no do not say so well go on,658,658,Q658
619,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way,659,659,Q659
620,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']",no indeed,660,660,Q660
621,Catherine Morland,[],how much better is this how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one,661,661,Q661
622,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but we have a charming morning after it and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth,662,662,Q662
623,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and how might you learn by accident or argument,663,663,Q663
624,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers,664,664,Q664
625,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose,665,665,Q665
626,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within,666,666,Q666
627,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction,667,667,Q667
628,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",this is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude woodston will make but a sombre appearance today,668,668,Q668
629,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']",is it a pretty place,669,669,Q669
630,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession,670,670,Q670
631,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day,671,671,Q671
632,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']",no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it,672,672,Q672
633,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",how were mr allen s succession houses worked,673,673,Q673
634,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']",mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then,674,674,Q674
635,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park,675,676,"Q675,Q676"
636,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'General Tilney']",this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp,677,677,Q677
637,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now,678,679,"Q678,Q679"
638,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction,680,681,"Q680,Q681"
639,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],a great and increasing one i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary,682,682,Q682
640,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],to be sure you must miss him very much,683,683,Q683
641,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other,684,684,Q684
642,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits her picture i suppose hangs in your father s room,685,687,"Q685,Q686,Q687"
643,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],no it was intended for the drawing room but my father was dissatisfied with the painting and for some time it had no place soon after her death i obtained it for my own and hung it in my bed chamber where i shall be happy to show it you it is very like,688,688,Q688
644,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",our friends from fullerton,689,689,Q689
645,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died,690,690,Q690
646,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],it remains as it was i suppose,691,691,Q691
647,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],yes entirely,692,692,Q692
648,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],and how long ago may it be that your mother died,693,693,Q693
649,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],she has been dead these nine years,694,694,Q694
650,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],you were with her i suppose to the last,695,695,Q695
651,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],no i was unfortunately from home her illness was sudden and short and before i arrived it was all over my father often walks about the room in this way it is nothing unusual,696,697,"Q696,Q697"
652,General Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i have many pamphlets to finish before i can close my eyes and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep can either of us be more meetly employed my eyes will be blinding for the good of others and yours preparing by rest for future mischief,698,698,Q698
653,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",eleanor,699,699,Q699
654,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],my father only wanted me to answer a note,700,700,Q700
655,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase,701,702,"Q701,Q702"
656,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine,703,704,"Q703,Q704"
657,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i have been to see your mother s room,705,705,Q705
658,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there,706,706,Q706
659,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow,707,707,Q707
660,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use,708,708,Q708
661,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride,709,709,Q709
662,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself,710,710,Q710
663,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us,711,712,"Q711,Q712"
664,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage,713,713,Q713
665,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress,714,714,Q714
666,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you,715,717,"Q715,Q716,Q717"
667,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,718,718,Q718
668,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose,719,719,Q719
669,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],no,720,720,Q720
670,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal,721,721,Q721
671,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,722,723,"Q722,Q723"
672,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin,724,725,"Q724,Q725"
673,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but your father was he afflicted,726,726,Q726
674,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death,727,727,Q727
675,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking,728,728,Q728
676,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting,729,729,Q729
677,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],tis only from james however,730,730,Q730
678,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill,731,731,Q731
679,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again,732,734,"Q732,Q733,Q734"
680,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings,735,735,Q735
681,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why,736,736,Q736
682,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress,737,737,Q737
683,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world,738,740,"Q738,Q739,Q740"
684,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story,741,741,Q741
685,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part,742,742,Q742
686,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother,743,743,Q743
687,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice,744,744,Q744
688,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son,745,745,Q745
689,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",her mother is a very good sort of woman,746,746,Q746
690,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",what was her father,747,747,Q747
691,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",a lawyer i believe they live at putney,748,748,Q748
692,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",are they a wealthy family,749,749,Q749
693,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children,750,750,Q750
694,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",but would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved,751,751,Q751
695,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise,752,752,Q752
696,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",such a sister in law henry i should delight in,753,753,Q753
697,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant,754,754,Q754
698,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals,755,755,Q755
699,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before,756,756,Q756
700,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",among all the great variety that you have known and studied,757,757,Q757
701,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it,758,758,Q758
702,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this,759,759,Q759
703,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,760,760,Q760
704,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves,761,761,Q761
705,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story,762,762,Q762
706,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney'],but he will tell only half of it,763,763,Q763
707,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],a quarter would be enough,764,764,Q764
708,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'General Tilney']",and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days,765,765,Q765
709,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney']",well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us,766,766,Q766
710,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it,767,767,Q767
711,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",go away and why,768,768,Q768
712,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure,769,769,Q769
713,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",oh not seriously,770,770,Q770
714,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay,771,771,Q771
715,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify,772,773,"Q772,Q773"
716,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return,774,774,Q774
717,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",we are not calling it a good house we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and confined we allow but decent perhaps and habitable and altogether not inferior to the generality or in other words i believe there are few country parsonages in england half so good it may admit of improvement however far be it from me to say otherwise and anything in reason a bow thrown out perhaps though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched on bow,775,775,Q775
718,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world,776,776,Q776
719,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",i trust that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste,777,777,Q777
720,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage,778,778,Q778
721,General Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains,779,779,Q779
722,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her,780,780,Q780
723,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",it will soon be as if you never had,781,781,Q781
724,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself,782,782,Q782
725,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause,783,783,Q783
726,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her,784,784,Q784
727,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",i am persuaded that he never did,785,785,Q785
728,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him,786,787,"Q786,Q787"
729,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment,788,788,Q788
730,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Henry Tilney']",it is very right that you should stand by your brother,789,789,Q789
731,Henry Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Eleanor Tilney']",and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge,790,790,Q790
732,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long,791,791,Q791
733,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again,792,792,Q792
734,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],good heaven what can be the matter my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand,793,794,"Q793,Q794"
735,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],errand to me,795,795,Q795
736,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you,796,796,Q796
737,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],tis a messenger from woodston,797,797,Q797
738,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],you are mistaken indeed it is no one from woodston it is my father himself you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either,798,799,"Q798,Q799"
739,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],my dear eleanor do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton,800,800,Q800
740,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],it will not be in my power catherine,801,801,Q801
741,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],come when you can then monday so soon as monday and you all go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home,802,803,"Q802,Q803"
742,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing,804,805,"Q804,Q805"
743,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],have i offended the general,806,806,Q806
744,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible,807,807,Q807
745,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],i am sure i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence,808,808,Q808
746,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended,809,809,Q809
747,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time,810,810,Q810
748,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i shall see you in the morning you must write to me catherine you must let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for one letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice,811,812,"Q811,Q812"
749,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe,813,813,Q813
750,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland'],i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you,814,814,Q814
751,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney'],oh eleanor i will write to you indeed,815,815,Q815
752,Mrs. Morland,"['Catherine Morland', 'Sarah']",my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble depend upon it it is something not at all worth understanding,816,816,Q816
753,Sarah,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Morland']",i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly,817,817,Q817
754,Mrs. Morland,"['Catherine Morland', 'Sarah']",i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets,818,819,"Q818,Q819"
755,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland'],this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping,820,820,Q820
756,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Morland'],no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor,821,821,Q821
757,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland'],if so my dear i dare say you will meet again some time or other do not be uneasy it is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years and then what a pleasure it will be we are sorry for him but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with and who was so entirely without fortune and now after such behaviour we cannot think at all well of her just at present it comes hard to poor james but that will not last forever and i dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life for the foolishness of his first choice,822,823,"Q822,Q823"
758,Mrs. Morland,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen', 'Mrs. Allen']",catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself,824,824,Q824
759,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen', 'Mrs. Morland']",i really have not patience with the general,825,825,Q825
760,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Morland']",i really have not patience with the general only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first,826,827,"Q826,Q827"
761,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mrs. Morland']",yes but that did not last long,828,828,Q828
762,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Morland']",very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening,829,829,Q829
763,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mrs. Morland']",do i oh perfectly,830,830,Q830
764,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Morland']",it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know,831,832,"Q831,Q832"
765,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland'],my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful,833,833,Q833
766,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Morland'],her head did not run upon bath much,834,834,Q834
767,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland'],then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger,835,836,"Q835,Q836"
768,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Morland'],i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat,837,837,Q837
769,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland'],there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good,838,838,Q838
770,Sarah,"['Catherine Morland', 'Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Morland']",you may see the house from this window sir,839,839,Q839
771,Mrs. Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mr. Morland']",catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure,840,840,Q840
