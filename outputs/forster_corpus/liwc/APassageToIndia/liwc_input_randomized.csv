p00006_A,00006,A,perhaps but later
p00007_A,00007,A,old callendar wants to see me at his bungalow he might have the politeness to say why
p00008_A,00008,A,i daresay not i daresay nothing he has found out our dinner hour that s all and chooses to interrupt us every time in order to show his power
p00009_A,00009,A,if my teeth are to be cleaned i don t go at all i am an indian it is an indian habit to take pan the civil surgeon must put up with it mohammed latif my bike please

p00011_A,00011,A,why no there are six people present in my small room already please remain seated if you will excuse the informality
p00012_A,00012,A,cyril again you desert
p00013_A,00013,A,my great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke
p00014_A,00014,A,i cannot endure committees i shall go right away
p00015_A,00015,A,but not in an indian state
p00016_A,00016,A,i do want to get away from british india even to a poor job i think i could write poetry there i wish i had lived in babur s time and fought and written for him gone gone and not even any use to say for it weakens us while we say it we need a king hamidullah it would make our lives easier as it is we must try to appreciate these quaint hindus my notion now is to try for some post as doctor in one of their states
p00017_A,00017,A,it is not going as far as mr ram chand
p00018_A,00018,A,i shall never be rich anywhere it is outside my character
p00019_A,00019,A,i chose not to discussion of the past is useless i have allowed her to keep her fortune and buy herself a husband in england for which it will be very necessary don t mention the matter again
p00020_A,00020,A,we are not in the law courts there are many ways of being a man mine is to express what is deepest in my heart
p00021_A,00021,A,which
p00022_A,00022,A,a pleasant change for her if he did
p00023_A,00023,A,just still your meaning doesn t help me out of my difficulties i am determined to leave chandrapore the problem is for where i am determined to write poetry the problem is about what you give me no assistance but who does give me assistance no one is my friend all are traitors even my own children i have had enough of friends
p00024_A,00024,A,i am sorry it is ever since i was in prison my temper is strange take me forgive me
p00025_A,00025,A,they come before me separately but not so far together you had better prepare them for the united shock of my face
p00026_A,00026,A,do not apologize you are always late
p00027_A,00027,A,yes that is so imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world
p00028_A,00028,A,we all admire them aziz please pass me the hookah
p00029_A,00029,A,i learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at cawnpore imagine how i long to see him and to pay his fare that this house may be his home but it is useless the other anglo indians will have got hold of him long ago he will probably think that i want something and i cannot face that from the son of my old friends oh what in this country has gone wrong with everything vakil sahib i ask you
p00030_A,00030,A,come and see my wife a little then
p00031_A,00031,A,yes he has done his duty do not tease him so he carries on his family two boys and their sister
p00032_A,00032,A,you mustn t put off what you think right that is why india is in such a plight because we put off things
p00033_A,00033,A,some case i daresay
p00034_A,00034,A,on the one hand he always does this on the other it may be a serious case and you cannot know had you not better clean your teeth after pan
p00035_A,00035,A,aziz aziz imprudent boy
p00036_A,00036,A,aziz he is trying to pull your leg don t believe him the villain
p00037_A,00037,A,it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand
p00038_A,00038,A,where to turtons and burtons all are the same
p00039_A,00039,A,i believe the politicals are obliged to have better manners it amounts to no more
p00040_A,00040,A,oh that is going much too far
p00041_A,00041,A,but the money the money they will never pay an adequate salary those savage rajahs
p00042_A,00042,A,if you had been sensible and made miss quested pay
p00043_A,00043,A,very well but your life must continue a poor man s no holidays in kashmir for you yet you must stick to your profession and rise to a highly paid post not retire to a jungle state and write poems educate your children read the latest scientific periodicals compel european doctors to respect you accept the consequences of your own actions like a man
p00044_A,00044,A,to such a remark there is certainly no reply have you heard this naughty rumour that mohammed latif has got hold of
p00045_A,00045,A,when miss quested stopped in the college fielding used to visit her rather too late in the evening the servants say
p00046_A,00046,A,but you understand my meaning
p00047_A,00047,A,i was going to suggest we go behind the purdah but your three treacherous children are there so you will not want to
p00048_A,00048,A,nureddin s mother is visiting my wife now that is all right i think
p00049_A,00049,A,no let us surprise them without warning far too much nonsense still goes on among our ladies they pretended at the time of your trial they would give up purdah indeed those of them who can write composed a document to that effect and now it ends in humbug you know how deeply they all respect fielding but not one of them has seen him my wife says she will but always when he calls there is some excuse she is not feeling well she is ashamed of the room she has no nice sweets to offer him only elephants ears and if i say elephants ears are mr fielding s favourite sweet she replies that he will know how badly hers are made so she cannot see him on their account for fifteen years my dear boy have i argued with my begum for fifteen years and never gained a point yet the missionaries inform us our women are down trodden if you want a subject for a poem take this the indian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be
p00050_A,00050,A,kindly answer my question am i late has mahmoud ali eaten all the food if so i go elsewhere mr mahmoud ali how are you
p00051_A,00051,A,dying before your dinner oh poor mahmoud ali
p00052_A,00052,A,why isn t cyril following let us turn back
p00053_A,00053,A,nureddin
p00054_A,00054,A,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00055_A,00055,A,thank you dr aziz i am dying
p00056_A,00056,A,down with the civil surgeon rescue nureddin
p00057_A,00057,A,they are torturing him
p00058_A,00058,A,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00059_A,00059,A,hamidullah here is actually dead he passed away just as you rode up on your bike
p00060_A,00060,A,well look at my own experience this morning
p00061_A,00061,A,it is impossible here aziz the red nosed boy has again insulted me in court i do not blame him he was told that he ought to insult me until lately he was quite a nice boy but the others have got hold of him
p00062_A,00062,A,he would expect you to steal it now turton but red nosed boy will be far worse than turton
p00063_A,00063,A,i do not for my own part i find such profound differences among our rulers red nose mumbles turton talks distinctly mrs turton takes bribes mrs red nose does not and cannot because so far there is no mrs red nose
p00064_A,00064,A,did you not know that when they were lent to central india over a canal scheme some rajah or other gave her a sewing machine in solid gold so that the water should run through his state
p00065_A,00065,A,no that is where mrs turton is so skilful when we poor blacks take bribes we perform what we are bribed to perform and the law discovers us in consequence the english take and do nothing i admire them
p00066_A,00066,A,queen victoria was different
p00067_A,00067,A,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00068_A,00068,A,aziz don t chatter we are having a very sad talk
p00069_A,00069,A,i only contend that it is possible in england
p00070_A,00070,A,yes they have no chance here that is my point they come out intending to be gentlemen and are told it will not do look at lesley look at blakiston now it is your red nosed boy and fielding will go next why i remember when turton came out first it was in another part of the province you fellows will not believe me but i have driven with turton in his carriage turton oh yes we were once quite intimate he has shown me his stamp collection
p00071_A,00071,A,i do not think so they all become exactly the same not worse not better i give any englishman two years be he turton or burton it is only the difference of a letter and i give any englishwoman six months all are exactly alike do you not agree with me
p00072_A,00072,A,bribes
p00073_A,00073,A,and does it
p00074_A,00074,A,you are a very selfish boy but take my case the case of young hugh bannister here is the son of my dear my dead friends the reverend and mrs bannister whose goodness to me in england i shall never forget or describe they were father and mother to me i talked to them as i do now in the vacations their rectory became my home they entrusted all their children to me i often carried little hugh about i took him up to the funeral of queen victoria and held him in my arms above the crowd
p00075_A,00075,A,no no i do not admit that i have met others
p00076_A,00076,A,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00077_A,00077,A,she said in the most natural way she offered me a lozenge when the dust irritated my throat
p00078_A,00078,A,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do
p00079_A,00079,A,what is to become of all our daughters if men refuse to marry they will marry beneath them or
p00080_A,00080,A,but the sahib has left me some message
p00081_A,00081,A,saying nothing then i will write him a letter tell him i have called that is sufficient here is my card call me a tonga
p00082_A,00082,A,mrs lesley it is a tonga
p00083_A,00083,A,o tonga wallah club club why doesn t the fool go
p00084_A,00084,A,i say is he ill or isn t he ill
p00085_A,00085,A,huzoor all are at the club
p00086_A,00086,A,madam madam madam
p00087_A,00087,A,madam this is a mosque you have no right here at all you should have taken off your shoes this is a holy place for moslems
p00088_A,00088,A,you have
p00089_A,00089,A,then i ask your pardon i am truly sorry for speaking
p00090_A,00090,A,of course but so few ladies take the trouble especially if thinking no one is there to see
p00091_A,00091,A,madam
p00092_A,00092,A,oh can i do you some service now or at any time
p00093_A,00093,A,may i know your name

p00095_A,00095,A,by the way you address me no but can i call you a carriage
p00096_A,00096,A,what was the name of the play
p00097_A,00097,A,i think you ought not to walk at night alone mrs moore there are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the marabar hills snakes also for example a six spot beetle you pick it up it bites you die
p00098_A,00098,A,oh i am used to it
p00099_A,00099,A,i m a doctor snakes don t dare bite me please may i ask you a question now why do you come to india at this time of year just as the cold weather is ending
p00100_A,00100,A,it will soon be so unhealthy for you and why ever do you come to chandrapore
p00101_A,00101,A,oh no excuse me that is quite impossible our city magistrate s name is mr heaslop i know him intimately
p00102_A,00102,A,but mrs moore how can he be
p00103_A,00103,A,yes now i see and your first husband died
p00104_A,00104,A,then we are in the same box then is the city magistrate the entire of your family now
p00105_A,00105,A,and the gentleman here is he ralph and stella s half brother
p00106_A,00106,A,mrs moore this is all extremely strange because like yourself i have also two sons and a daughter is not this the same box with a vengeance
p00107_A,00107,A,no indeed how funny it sounds their names are quite different and will surprise you listen please i am about to tell you my children s names the first is called ahmed the second is called karim the third she is the eldest jamila three children are enough do not you agree with me
p00108_A,00108,A,would you care to see over the minto hospital one morning i have nothing else to offer at chandrapore
p00109_A,00109,A,i suppose the civil surgeon took you
p00110_A,00110,A,ah a very charming lady
p00111_A,00111,A,what what you didn t like her
p00112_A,00112,A,she has just taken my tonga without my permission do you call that being charming and major callendar interrupts me night after night from where i am dining with my friends and i go at once breaking up a most pleasant entertainment and he is not there and not even a message is this charming pray but what does it matter i can do nothing and he knows it i am just a subordinate my time is of no value the verandah is good enough for an indian yes yes let him stand and mrs callendar takes my carriage and cuts me dead you understand me you know what others feel oh if others resembled you
p00113_A,00113,A,there honestly is none we are by nature a most informal people
p00114_A,00114,A,that is even more impossible but may i know the facts
p00115_A,00115,A,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00116_A,00116,A,mine would god would give me more when he saw i gave always be giving like the nawab bahadur my father was the same that is why he died poor so we would sit giving for ever on a carpet instead of chairs that is the chief change between now and then but i think we would never punish anyone poor criminal give him another chance it only makes a man worse to go to prison and be corrupted we punish no one no one and in the evening we will give a great banquet with a nautch and lovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks in their hands and all shall be feasting and happiness until the next day when there shall be justice as before fifty rupees a hundred a thousand till peace comes ah why didn t we live in that time but are you admiring mr fielding s house do look how the pillars are painted blue and the verandah s pavilions what do you call them that are above us inside are blue also look at the carving on the pavilions think of the hours it took their little roofs are curved to imitate bamboo so pretty and the bamboos waving by the tank outside mrs moore mrs moore
p00117_A,00117,A,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00118_A,00118,A,how is that oh explain to me
p00119_A,00119,A,do you ever remember our mosque mrs moore
p00120_A,00120,A,and how rough and rude i was and how good you were
p00121_A,00121,A,certainly miss quested so you and i will go together and leave mrs moore here and we will not be long yet we will not hurry because we know that will be her wish
p00122_A,00122,A,dear mrs moore what does anything matter so long as you are my guests i am very glad you are not coming which sounds strange but you are treating me with true frankness as a friend yes i am your friend so may i make another suggestion don t let so many people come with you this time i think you may find it more convenient exactly exactly is that all right
p00123_A,00123,A,oh oh
p00124_A,00124,A,i have taken them off
p00125_A,00125,A,i left them at the entrance
p00126_A,00126,A,yes i was right was i not if i remove my shoes i am allowed
p00127_A,00127,A,that makes no difference god is here

p00132_A,00132,A,i have only come from the club they are doing a play that i have seen in london and it was so hot
p00133_A,00133,A,cousin kate
p00134_A,00134,A,but you walk about yourself
p00135_A,00135,A,used to snakes
p00136_A,00136,A,i intended to start earlier but there was an unavoidable delay
p00137_A,00137,A,to visit my son he is the city magistrate here
p00138_A,00138,A,he s my son all the same
p00139_A,00139,A,i was married twice
p00140_A,00140,A,he did and so did my second husband
p00141_A,00141,A,no there are the younger ones ralph and stella in england
p00142_A,00142,A,quite right
p00143_A,00143,A,what are their names not also ronny ralph and stella surely
p00144_A,00144,A,i do
p00145_A,00145,A,thank you i have seen it already or i should have liked to come with you very much
p00146_A,00146,A,yes and mrs callendar
p00147_A,00147,A,possibly when one knows her better
p00148_A,00148,A,she was certainly intending to be kind but i did not find her exactly charming
p00149_A,00149,A,i don t think i understand people very well i only know whether i like or dislike them
p00150_A,00150,A,i am afraid we must have made some blunder and given offence
p00151_A,00151,A,india s oh what an alarming idea
p00152_A,00152,A,rupees don t last for ever i m afraid
p00153_A,00153,A,well
p00154_A,00154,A,good bye dr aziz
p00155_A,00155,A,get in get in you ll kill yourself as well as mr fielding i see no ruin
p00156_A,00156,A,i do i do
p00157_A,00157,A,and how happy we both were
p00158_A,00158,A,quite right i m sorry not to come too but i m a poor walker
p00159_A,00159,A,aziz where have you put miss quested to
p00160_A,00160,A,i want to see the real india
p00161_A,00161,A,it ll end in an elephant ride it always does look at this evening cousin kate imagine cousin kate but where have you been off to did you succeed in catching the moon in the ganges
p00162_A,00162,A,the angle would have altered she rises later
p00163_A,00163,A,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00164_A,00164,A,was he nice
p00165_A,00165,A,i dislike them not because i m english but from my own personal point of view
p00166_A,00166,A,and nasty
p00167_A,00167,A,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00168_A,00168,A,i suppose so
p00169_A,00169,A,you heard me tell aziz and godbole i wasn t stopping in their country i didn t mean it so why did i say it i feel i haven t been frank enough attentive enough or something it s as if i got everything out of proportion you have been so very good to me and i meant to be good when i sailed but somehow i haven t been mrs moore if one isn t absolutely honest what is the use of existing
p00170_A,00170,A,you mean that my bothers are mixed up with india
p00171_A,00171,A,what made you call it a ghost
p00172_A,00172,A,the animal thing that hit us didn t you say oh a ghost in passing
p00173_A,00173,A,it was probably a hyena as a matter of fact
p00174_A,00174,A,what a nice cheerful servant what a relief after antony
p00175_A,00175,A,i want to sack antony his behaviour on the platform has decided me anyhow we must get a second servant because at simla you will be at the hotel and i don t think ronny s baldeo
p00176_A,00176,A,i don t believe in the hot weather people like major callendar who always talk about it it s in the hope of making one feel inexperienced and small like their everlasting i ve been twenty years in this country
p00177_A,00177,A,i won t be bottled up i ve no patience with these women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains mrs mcbryde hasn t stopped down once since she married she leaves her quite intelligent husband alone half the year and then s surprised she s out of touch with him
p00178_A,00178,A,oh yes that s true
p00179_A,00179,A,oh yes you re perfectly right i never thought it out
p00180_A,00180,A,my idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in simla at all events to see me through the wedding after which ronny means to reorganize his staff entirely he does it very well for a bachelor still when he is married no doubt various changes will have to be made his old servants won t want to take their orders from me and i don t blame them anything to be seen of the hills
p00181_A,00181,A,we can t be far from the place where my hyena was perhaps this is mine anyhow the road runs parallel with the railway i will fetch you from simla when it s cool enough i will unbottle you in fact we then see some of the mogul stuff how appalling if we let you miss the taj and then i will see you off at bombay your last glimpse of this country really shall be interesting they re rather wonderful i ld not have missed this for anything look the sun s rising this ll be absolutely magnificent come quickly look i wouldn t have missed this for anything we should never have seen it if we d stuck to the turtons and their eternal elephants ah that must be the false dawn isn t it caused by dust in the upper layers of the atmosphere that couldn t fall down during the night i think mr mcbryde said so well i must admit that england has it as regards sunrises do you remember grasmere
p00182_A,00182,A,a snake it isn t a snake
p00183_A,00183,A,mrs moore may i put our difficulty to dr aziz i mean our anglo indian one
p00184_A,00184,A,but he says this isn t a good cave the best are on the kawa dol
p00185_A,00185,A,very well let s sit down again in the shade until breakfast s ready
p00186_A,00186,A,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00187_A,00187,A,yes i mean that at least not exactly but there is this echo that i keep on hearing
p00188_A,00188,A,i can t get rid of it
p00189_A,00189,A,mrs moore what is this echo
p00190_A,00190,A,no what is it oh do say i felt you would be able to explain it this will comfort me so
p00191_A,00191,A,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00192_A,00192,A,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00193_A,00193,A,i thought you said but it was in mr fielding s letter
p00194_A,00194,A,i know but
p00195_A,00195,A,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00196_A,00196,A,i want to see it too and i only wish we could apparently the turtons will arrange something for next tuesday
p00197_A,00197,A,i went to the mosque but i did not catch the moon
p00198_A,00198,A,ah yes so the young man there said
p00199_A,00199,A,i was going to tell you adela but something changed the conversation and i forgot my memory grows deplorable
p00200_A,00200,A,i believe that you have oh please it distresses me beyond words
p00201_A,00201,A,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00202_A,00202,A,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00203_A,00203,A,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00204_A,00204,A,will you play patience with your future mother in law dear adela or does it seem too tame
p00205_A,00205,A,that s much the best feeling to have
p00206_A,00206,A,i feared at mr fielding s that it might be settled the other way black knave on a red queen
p00207_A,00207,A,i wouldn t worry it s partly the odd surroundings you and i keep on attending to trifles instead of what s important we are what the people here call new
p00208_A,00208,A,india s
p00209_A,00209,A,call what a ghost
p00210_A,00210,A,i couldn t have been thinking of what i was saying
p00211_A,00211,A,we shall be all moslems together now as you promised
p00212_A,00212,A,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00213_A,00213,A,very well you get another servant and i ll keep antony with me i am used to his unappetizing ways he will see me through the hot weather
p00214_A,00214,A,i believe in the hot weather but never did i suppose it would bottle me up as it will
p00215_A,00215,A,she has children you see
p00216_A,00216,A,it is the children who are the first consideration until they are grown up and married off when that happens one has again the right to live for oneself in the plains or the hills as suits
p00217_A,00217,A,if one has not become too stupid and old
p00218_A,00218,A,only various shades of the dark
p00219_A,00219,A,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00220_A,00220,A,i forget
p00221_A,00221,A,i don t think i shall go on to there i dislike climbing
p00222_A,00222,A,ah but that ll disappoint him so he has taken such trouble you should go on you don t mind
p00223_A,00223,A,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00224_A,00224,A,oh what of the echo
p00225_A,00225,A,i don t suppose you ever will
p00226_A,00226,A,don t you know
p00227_A,00227,A,if you don t know you don t know i can t tell you
p00228_A,00228,A,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00229_A,00229,A,i never said his name
p00230_A,00230,A,of course he is innocent
p00231_A,00231,A,oh how tedious trivial oh why is everything still my duty when shall i be free from your fuss was he in the cave and were you in the cave and on and on and unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and am i good and is he bad and are we saved and ending everything the echo
p00232_A,00232,A,come india s not as bad as all that other side of the earth if you like but we stick to the same old moon
p00233_A,00233,A,listen mohammed latif says good morning next
p00234_A,00234,A,fielding how s one to see the real india
p00235_A,00235,A,i say old man do excuse me but i think perhaps you oughtn t to have left miss quested alone
p00236_A,00236,A,well i m the sun dried bureaucrat no doubt still i don t like to see an english girl left smoking with two indians
p00237_A,00237,A,yes that s all right in england
p00238_A,00238,A,if you can t see you can t see can t you see that fellow s a bounder
p00239_A,00239,A,what should have upset his precious nerves
p00240_A,00240,A,well it s nothing i ve said i never even spoke to him
p00241_A,00241,A,fielding don t think i m taking it badly or anything of that sort i suppose you won t come on to the polo with us we should all be delighted
p00242_A,00242,A,let him go
p00243_A,00243,A,i came to bring miss quested away but her visit to the turtons has ended and there is no other arrangement so far mine are bachelor quarters now
p00244_A,00244,A,i wish to thank you for the help you have given miss quested she will not of course trespass on your hospitality further she has as a matter of fact decided to return to england i have just arranged about her passage for her i understand she would like to see you
p00245_A,00245,A,who was that
p00246_A,00246,A,yes indeed
p00247_A,00247,A,our schoolmaster government college
p00248_A,00248,A,das is really
p00249_A,00249,A,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00250_A,00250,A,oh lucky you
p00251_A,00251,A,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00252_A,00252,A,let me explain natives don t respect one any the more after meeting one you see
p00253_A,00253,A,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00254_A,00254,A,that occurs after so many meetings
p00255_A,00255,A,even from one s patients
p00256_A,00256,A,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00257_A,00257,A,how if he went to heaven
p00258_A,00258,A,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00259_A,00259,A,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00260_A,00260,A,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00261_A,00261,A,drink it up not a bad notion a peg
p00262_A,00262,A,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p00263_A,00263,A,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00264_A,00264,A,i can t eat might i have a little brandy
p00265_A,00265,A,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00266_A,00266,A,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00267_A,00267,A,if i do break down it is of no consequence it would matter in some trials not in this i put it to myself in the following way i can really behave as i like cry be absurd i am sure to get my verdict unless mr das is most frightfully unjust
p00268_A,00268,A,well we don t come across them socially they re full of all the virtues but we don t and it s now eleven thirty and too late to go into the reasons
p00269_A,00269,A,to work mary to work
p00270_A,00270,A,come along mary get it over
p00271_A,00271,A,whom have we so far h m h m much as one expected we know why he s here i think over that contract and he wants to get the right side of me for mohurram and he s the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations and he s that parsi and he s hullo there he goes smash into our hollyhocks pulled the left rein when he meant the right all as usual
p00272_A,00272,A,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00273_A,00273,A,everything absolutely normal
p00274_A,00274,A,merely the preparations for it the procession is not till next week
p00275_A,00275,A,jail bail has been refused i hope callendar may be able to let us know how things are going before long
p00276_A,00276,A,she s saying her prayers
p00277_A,00277,A,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00278_A,00278,A,you won t
p00279_A,00279,A,mcbryde s an old woman
p00280_A,00280,A,miss quested what a name
p00281_A,00281,A,what do you want me to do oh those purdah women i never thought any would come oh dear i consider they ought to come over to me
p00282_A,00282,A,i refuse to shake hands with any of the men unless it has to be the nawab bahadur
p00283_A,00283,A,and they re not coming to the burra sahib s bungalow either my dear and that s where you and your baby ll sleep tonight
p00284_A,00284,A,harry is there any news from the city
p00285_A,00285,A,i had gathered as much those drums are merely mohurram of course
p00286_A,00286,A,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00287_A,00287,A,miss quested adela what d ye call yourself it s half past seven we ought to think of starting for that court when you feel inclined
p00288_A,00288,A,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00289_A,00289,A,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00290_A,00290,A,it s decent of the burra sahib do you know he s never given a bridge party before coming on top of the dinner too i wish i could have arranged something myself but when you know the natives better you ll realize it s easier for the burra sahib than for me they know him they know he can t be fooled i m still fresh comparatively no one can even begin to think of knowing this country until he has been in it twenty years hullo the mater here s your cloak well for an example of the mistakes one makes soon after i came out i asked one of the pleaders to have a smoke with me only a cigarette mind i found afterwards that he had sent touts all over the bazaar to announce the fact told all the litigants ever since then i ve dropped on him in court as hard as i could it s taught me a lesson and i hope him
p00291_A,00291,A,perhaps but time s limited and the flesh weak i prefer my smoke at the club amongst my own sort i m afraid
p00292_A,00292,A,oh good gracious not a mohammedan why ever didn t you tell me you d been talking to a native i was going all wrong
p00293_A,00293,A,you oughtn t to have answered
p00294_A,00294,A,it s different it s different you don t understand
p00295_A,00295,A,what s happened to fielding where s my mother
p00296_A,00296,A,i want you and mother at once there s to be polo
p00297_A,00297,A,what was that about caves
p00298_A,00298,A,out where
p00299_A,00299,A,well i m blessed did he descend to any details
p00300_A,00300,A,i was only thinking how the worthy doctor s collar climbed up his neck
p00301_A,00301,A,so i am aziz was exquisitely dressed from tie pin to spats but he had forgotten his back collar stud and there you have the indian all over inattention to detail the fundamental slackness that reveals the race similarly to meet in the caves as if they were the clock at charing cross when they re miles from a station and each other
p00302_A,00302,A,no but i know all about them naturally
p00303_A,00303,A,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00304_A,00304,A,no but aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves he meant nothing by the invitation i could tell by his voice it s just their way of being pleasant
p00305_A,00305,A,you never said we should marry my dear girl you never bound either yourself or me don t let this upset you
p00306_A,00306,A,i don t much believe in this discussing besides i m so dead with all this extra work mohurram s bringing if you ll excuse me
p00307_A,00307,A,but i haven t got any questions you ve acted within your rights you were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my work it was an excellent plan and anyhow it s no use talking further we should only get up steam
p00308_A,00308,A,as we are british i suppose it is
p00309_A,00309,A,oh that would have been too absurd why should we quarrel
p00310_A,00310,A,i know we shall
p00311_A,00311,A,do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is bee eater
p00312_A,00312,A,parrot
p00313_A,00313,A,mcbryde has an illustrated bird book i m no good at all at birds in fact i m useless at any information outside my own job it s a great pity
p00314_A,00314,A,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00315_A,00315,A,why
p00316_A,00316,A,frightened adela
p00317_A,00317,A,wasn t the bridge we skidded
p00318_A,00318,A,i say adela what was it
p00319_A,00319,A,our old gentleman is helpful and sound as he always is over public affairs you ve seen in him our show indian
p00320_A,00320,A,when the animal runs into us the nawab loses his head deserts his unfortunate chauffeur intrudes upon miss derek no great crimes no great crimes but no white man would have done it
p00321_A,00321,A,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion
p00322_A,00322,A,dear old girl to say so
p00323_A,00323,A,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00324_A,00324,A,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00325_A,00325,A,well my dear girl this isn t much of a home coming i had no idea she had this up her sleeve
p00326_A,00326,A,you re over tired
p00327_A,00327,A,well sit down anyhow
p00328_A,00328,A,that s good you ll be perfectly well in a few days but you must save yourself up for the trial das is a very good fellow we shall all be with you
p00329_A,00329,A,i don t quite know what you re saying and i don t think you do
p00330_A,00330,A,he was let out until the mohurram riot when he had to be put in again half a minute
p00331_A,00331,A,heard what
p00332_A,00332,A,mother never said so
p00333_A,00333,A,she never mentioned that name once
p00334_A,00334,A,pure illusion you can t be quite well can you to make up a thing like that
p00335_A,00335,A,i was listening to all she said as far as it could be listened to she gets very incoherent
p00336_A,00336,A,those words
p00337_A,00337,A,never never my dear girl complete illusion his name was not mentioned by anyone look here you are confusing this with fielding s letter
p00338_A,00338,A,you were not right she never said it
p00339_A,00339,A,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00340_A,00340,A,and most inconsiderate to adela
p00341_A,00341,A,what was i warning you just now you know you re right and the whole station knows it
p00342_A,00342,A,isn t the lesson that you should invite all the pleaders to have a smoke with you
p00343_A,00343,A,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00344_A,00344,A,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00345_A,00345,A,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00346_A,00346,A,i know i don t and i want to what is the difference please
p00347_A,00347,A,good evening
p00348_A,00348,A,i thought there was to be no polo
p00349_A,00349,A,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00350_A,00350,A,the marabar caves
p00351_A,00351,A,he did not if you had spoken to him we could have arranged them have i said anything funny
p00352_A,00352,A,i thought you were discussing the caves
p00353_A,00353,A,have you been to them
p00354_A,00354,A,oh naturally
p00355_A,00355,A,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00356_A,00356,A,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00357_A,00357,A,it s nothing to do with them that i
p00358_A,00358,A,it s something very different nothing to do with caves that i wanted to talk over with you i ve finally decided we are not going to be married my dear boy
p00359_A,00359,A,but let us discuss things it s all so frightfully important we mustn t make false steps i want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both
p00360_A,00360,A,i only want everything to be absolutely clear between us and to answer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct
p00361_A,00361,A,i suppose that there is nothing else it s unpardonable of me to have given you and your mother all this bother yes nothing else we ve been awfully british over it but i suppose that s all right
p00362_A,00362,A,anyhow we ve not quarrelled ronny
p00363_A,00363,A,i think we shall keep friends
p00364_A,00364,A,quite so
p00365_A,00365,A,oh no ronny it has red bars on its wings
p00366_A,00366,A,good gracious no
p00367_A,00367,A,how do you do
p00368_A,00368,A,oughtn t we to get back to the bungalow
p00369_A,00369,A,i think perhaps i ought to see your mother and discuss future plans
p00370_A,00370,A,a large animal rushed up out of the dark on the right and hit us
p00371_A,00371,A,of course i m right i saw its hairy back quite plainly
p00372_A,00372,A,ronny i should like to take back what i said on the maidan
p00373_A,00373,A,what does our old gentleman of the car think
p00374_A,00374,A,have i really
p00375_A,00375,A,what animal
p00376_A,00376,A,can mrs moore be with me
p00377_A,00377,A,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00378_A,00378,A,dear old boy ronny she isn t ill too
p00379_A,00379,A,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00380_A,00380,A,aziz aziz aziz have i made a mistake
p00381_A,00381,A,ronny he s innocent i made an awful mistake
p00382_A,00382,A,my echo s better
p00383_A,00383,A,but ronny dear ronny perhaps there oughtn t to be any trial
p00384_A,00384,A,if dr aziz never did it he ought to be let out
p00385_A,00385,A,help me to do what i ought aziz is good you heard your mother say so
p00386_A,00386,A,he s good i ve been so wrong to accuse him
p00387_A,00387,A,didn t she
p00388_A,00388,A,but ronny i heard her
p00389_A,00389,A,i suppose i can t how amazing of me
p00390_A,00390,A,when her voice dropped she said it towards the end when she talked about love love i couldn t follow but just then she said doctor aziz never did it
p00391_A,00391,A,the idea more than the words
p00392_A,00392,A,that s it that s it i knew i d heard his name somewhere i am so grateful to you for clearing this up it s the sort of mistake that worries me and proves i m neurotic
p00393_A,00393,A,you see ronny i was right
p00394_A,00394,A,but she thinks it
p00395_A,00395,A,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00396_A,00396,A,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00397_A,00397,A,not allowed
p00398_A,00398,A,been there when
p00399_A,00399,A,but mother you can t do that sort of thing
p00400_A,00400,A,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening
p00401_A,00401,A,who was he
p00402_A,00402,A,a doctor i know of no young doctor in chandrapore how odd what was he like
p00403_A,00403,A,i wish you had pointed him out to me i can t make out who he is
p00404_A,00404,A,he called to you in the mosque did he how impudently what was he doing there himself at that time of night no it s not their prayer time so he called to you over your shoes then it was impudence it s an old trick i wish you had had them on
p00405_A,00405,A,there s your ganges it s not much of a dead body that gets down to chandrapore
p00406_A,00406,A,so you and he had a talk did you gather he was well disposed
p00407_A,00407,A,i meant generally did he seem to tolerate us the brutal conqueror the sundried bureaucrat that sort of thing
p00408_A,00408,A,oh so he told you that did he the major will be interested i wonder what was the aim of the remark
p00409_A,00409,A,yes rather i must in fact
p00410_A,00410,A,if the major heard i was disliked by any native subordinate of mine i should expect him to pass it on to me
p00411_A,00411,A,nothing s private in india aziz knew that when he spoke out so don t you worry he had some motive in what he said my personal belief is that the remark wasn t true
p00412_A,00412,A,he abused the major in order to impress you
p00413_A,00413,A,it s the educated native s latest dodge they used to cringe but the younger generation believe in a show of manly independence they think it will pay better with the itinerant m p but whether the native swaggers or cringes there s always something behind every remark he makes always something and if nothing else he s trying to increase his izzat in plain anglo saxon to score of course there are exceptions
p00414_A,00414,A,india isn t home
p00415_A,00415,A,in return please don t talk about aziz to adela
p00416_A,00416,A,there you go again mother i really can t explain every thing i don t want adela to be worried that s the fact she ll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly and all that sort of nonsense
p00417_A,00417,A,i know
p00418_A,00418,A,does adela talk to you much i m so driven with work i don t see her as much as i hoped but i hope she finds things comfortable
p00419_A,00419,A,yes perhaps but then people ld gossip
p00420_A,00420,A,people are so odd out here and it s not like home one s always facing the footlights as the burra sahib said take a silly little example when adela went out to the boundary of the club compound and fielding followed her i saw mrs callendar notice it they notice everything until they re perfectly sure you re their sort
p00421_A,00421,A,i know that s so remarkable about her i suppose nothing s on her mind
p00422_A,00422,A,probably she s heard tales of the heat but of course i should pack her off to the hills every april i m not one to keep a wife grilling in the plains
p00423_A,00423,A,there s nothing in india but the weather my dear mother it s the alpha and omega of the whole affair
p00424_A,00424,A,what did i tell you i knew it last week oh how like a woman to worry over a side issue
p00425_A,00425,A,we re not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly
p00426_A,00426,A,what i say we re out here to do justice and keep the peace them s my sentiments india isn t a drawing room
p00427_A,00427,A,india likes gods
p00428_A,00428,A,there s no point in all this here we are and we re going to stop and the country s got to put up with us gods or no gods oh look here what do you and adela want me to do go against my class against all the people i respect and admire out here lose such power as i have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn t pleasant you neither of you understand what work is or you ld never talk such eyewash i hate talking like this but one must occasionally it s morbidly sensitive to go on as adela and you do i noticed you both at the club to day after the burra sahib had been at all that trouble to amuse you i am out here to work mind to hold this wretched country by force i m not a missionary or a labour member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man i m just a servant of the government it s the profession you wanted me to choose myself and that s that we re not pleasant in india and we don t intend to be pleasant we ve something more important to do
p00429_A,00429,A,how do you make that out mother
p00430_A,00430,A,i quite see that i suppose i ought to get off to my files now and you ll be going to bed
p00431_A,00431,A,are you too pledged to this expedition mother
p00432_A,00432,A,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00433_A,00433,A,look here both of you see india if you like and as you like i know i made myself rather ridiculous at fielding s but it s different now i wasn t quite sure of myself
p00434_A,00434,A,i m afraid so incredible aren t they even the best of them they re all they all forget their back collar studs sooner or later you ve had to do with three sets of indians to day the bhattacharyas aziz and this chap and it really isn t a coincidence that they ve all let you down
p00435_A,00435,A,oh we had a small accident on the marabar road adela thinks it was a hyena
p00436_A,00436,A,nothing no one hurt our excellent host awoke much rattled from his dreams appeared to think it was our fault and chanted exactly exactly
p00437_A,00437,A,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00438_A,00438,A,are you all right you appeared all right when i left
p00439_A,00439,A,we can go into that later can t we
p00440_A,00440,A,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00441_A,00441,A,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00442_A,00442,A,you can t go to england in may as you agreed
p00443_A,00443,A,well we d better end this unexpected wrangle you appear to want to be left out of everything and that s enough
p00444_A,00444,A,what do you want can you state it in simple language if so do
p00445_A,00445,A,who cares what she thinks
p00446_A,00446,A,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00447_A,00447,A,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00448_A,00448,A,feeble mother feeble
p00449_A,00449,A,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00450_A,00450,A,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00451_A,00451,A,between the acts
p00452_A,00452,A,can t mother
p00453_A,00453,A,very nice
p00454_A,00454,A,a doctor i don t know his name
p00455_A,00455,A,rather small with a little moustache and quick eyes he called out to me when i was in the dark part of the mosque about my shoes that was how we began talking he was afraid i had them on but i remembered luckily he told me about his children and then we walked back to the club he knows you well
p00456_A,00456,A,he didn t come into the club he said he wasn t allowed to
p00457_A,00457,A,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00458_A,00458,A,aziz what a charming name
p00459_A,00459,A,yes quite after the first moment
p00460_A,00460,A,oh yes i think so except the callendars he doesn t care for the callendars at all
p00461_A,00461,A,ronny ronny you re never going to pass it on to major callendar
p00462_A,00462,A,but my dear boy
p00463_A,00463,A,but my dear boy a private conversation
p00464_A,00464,A,how not true
p00465_A,00465,A,i don t know what you mean dear
p00466_A,00466,A,you never used to judge people like this at home
p00467_A,00467,A,i can t deny that what you say sounds very sensible but you really must not hand on to major callendar anything i have told you about doctor aziz
p00468_A,00468,A,not talk about him why
p00469_A,00469,A,but she came out to be worried that s exactly why she s here she discussed it all on the boat we had a long talk when we went on shore at aden she knows you in play as she put it but not in work and she felt she must come and look round before she decided and before you decided she is very very fair minded
p00470_A,00470,A,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00471_A,00471,A,well they must gossip sometime let them gossip
p00472_A,00472,A,i don t think adela ll ever be quite their sort she s much too individual
p00473_A,00473,A,ask her ask her yourself my dear boy
p00474_A,00474,A,oh it wouldn t be the weather
p00475_A,00475,A,yes as mr mcbryde was saying but it s much more the anglo indians themselves who are likely to get on adela s nerves she doesn t think they behave pleasantly to indians you see
p00476_A,00476,A,a side issue a side issue how can it be that
p00477_A,00477,A,what do you mean
p00478_A,00478,A,your sentiments are those of a god
p00479_A,00479,A,and englishmen like posing as gods
p00480_A,00480,A,i m going to argue and indeed dictate the english are out here to be pleasant
p00481_A,00481,A,because india is part of the earth and god has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant to each other god is love god has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show it and he is omnipresent even in india to see how we are succeeding
p00482_A,00482,A,the desire to behave pleasantly satisfies god the sincere if impotent desire wins his blessing i think every one fails but there are so many kinds of failure good will and more good will and more good will though i speak with the tongues of
p00483_A,00483,A,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00484_A,00484,A,an accident
p00485_A,00485,A,a ghost
p00486_A,00486,A,here you are both back
p00487_A,00487,A,i am all right as a matter of fact i have been looking at my return ticket it is interchangeable so i have a much larger choice of boats home than i thought
p00488_A,00488,A,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00489_A,00489,A,say say say as if anything can be said i have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings i have listened too much it is time i was left in peace not to die no doubt you expect me to die but when i have seen you and ronny married and seen the other two and whether they want to be married i ll retire then into a cave of my own somewhere where no young people will come asking questions and expecting answers some shelf
p00490_A,00490,A,why should i be in the witness box
p00491_A,00491,A,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00492_A,00492,A,i have changed my mind
p00493_A,00493,A,my body my miserable body why isn t it strong oh why can t i walk away and be gone why can t i finish my duties and be gone why do i get headaches and puff when i walk and all the time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and that to do in her way and everything sympathy and confusion and bearing one another s burdens why can t this be done and that be done in my way and they be done and i at peace why has anything to be done i cannot see why all this marriage marriage the human race would have become a single person centuries ago if marriage was any use and all this rubbish about love love in a church love in a cave as if there is the least difference and i held up from my business over such trifles
p00494_A,00494,A,i want my pack of patience cards
p00495_A,00495,A,red nine on black ten
p00496_A,00496,A,is it again my duty to talk apparently as you keep interrupting me
p00497_A,00497,A,i am not good no bad a bad old woman bad bad detestable i used to be good with the children growing up also i meet this young man in his mosque i wanted him to be happy good happy small people they do not exist they were a dream but i will not help you to torture him for what he never did there are different ways of evil and i prefer mine to yours
p00498_A,00498,A,one knows people s characters as you call them i have heard both english and indians speak well of him and i felt it isn t the sort of thing he would do
p00499_A,00499,A,most feeble
p00500_A,00500,A,it is owing to orders from the l g turton would never do this unless compelled those high officials are different they sympathize the viceroy sympathizes they would have us treated properly but they come too seldom and live too far away meanwhile
p00501_A,00501,A,we have not all your sweet nature nawab bahadur nor your learning
p00502_A,00502,A,mr ram chand the nawab bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation i think
p00503_A,00503,A,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00504_A,00504,A,they put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds
p00505_A,00505,A,it is easy to sympathize at a distance i value more the kind word that is spoken close to my ear mr turton has spoken it from whatever cause he speaks we hear i do not see why we need discuss it further
p00506_A,00506,A,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p00507_A,00507,A,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00508_A,00508,A,the lieutenant governor may be my very good friend but i give him no trouble and all is over but i can be a thorn in mr turton s flesh and if he asks me i accept the invitation i shall come in from dilkusha specially though i have to postpone other business
p00509_A,00509,A,you will make yourself chip
p00510_A,00510,A,mr mahmoud ali
p00511_A,00511,A,mr ram chand
p00512_A,00512,A,it is only just five my husband will be up from his office in a moment and start the thing i have no idea what we have to do it s the first time we ve ever given a party like this at the club mr heaslop when i m dead and gone will you give parties like this it s enough to make the old type of burra sahib turn in his grave
p00513_A,00513,A,absolutely true
p00514_A,00514,A,in fact you disapprove of the appeal i forwarded to lady mellanby pray don t apologize mr heaslop i am accustomed to being in the wrong
p00515_A,00515,A,you wanted something not picturesque and we ve provided it what do you think of the aryan brother in a topi and spats the great point to remember is that no one who s here matters those who matter don t come isn t that so mrs turton
p00516_A,00516,A,i didn t mean that
p00517_A,00517,A,well done das quite sound
p00518_A,00518,A,they ought never to have been allowed to drive in it s so bad for them why they come at all i don t know they hate it as much as we do talk to mrs mcbryde her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck
p00519_A,00519,A,you re superior to them anyway don t forget that you re superior to everyone in india except one or two of the ranis and they re on an equality is that what you wanted
p00520_A,00520,A,oh yes they re english speaking
p00521_A,00521,A,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00522_A,00522,A,i should think i did champagne too
p00523_A,00523,A,how about aspirin
p00524_A,00524,A,of course she won t she s a real sport
p00525_A,00525,A,yes my dear child
p00526_A,00526,A,this isn t a purdah party
p00527_A,00527,A,i ll thank you this evening i m all to pieces now my echo has come back again badly
p00528_A,00528,A,but mrs turton
p00529_A,00529,A,oh really
p00530_A,00530,A,do kindly tell us who these ladies are

p00532_A,00532,A,eastbourne piccadilly high park corner
p00533_A,00533,A,no of course not and anyhow they re not coming to the club
p00534_A,00534,A,she knows paris also
p00535_A,00535,A,they pass paris on the way no doubt
p00536_A,00536,A,the shorter lady she is my wife she is mrs bhattacharya the taller lady she is my sister she is mrs das
p00537_A,00537,A,no of course not we are not such people
p00538_A,00538,A,i wonder whether you would allow us to call on you some day
p00539_A,00539,A,whenever is convenient
p00540_A,00540,A,thursday
p00541_A,00541,A,we shall enjoy it greatly it would be a real pleasure what about the time
p00542_A,00542,A,when
p00543_A,00543,A,all days are convenient
p00544_A,00544,A,most certainly
p00545_A,00545,A,thursday
p00546_A,00546,A,all hours
p00547_A,00547,A,we leave for calcutta to day
p00548_A,00548,A,tell us which you would prefer we re quite strangers to your country we don t know when you have visitors
p00549_A,00549,A,yes yes you come to us thursday
p00550_A,00550,A,but you ll be in calcutta
p00551_A,00551,A,no no we shall not we expect you thursday
p00552_A,00552,A,you can t have done such a dreadful thing as to put off going for our sake
p00553_A,00553,A,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00554_A,00554,A,much the best thing to be in this place
p00555_A,00555,A,i know i know and we never get down from it i envy you being with indians
p00556_A,00556,A,very very much indeed it s what i long for this party to day makes me so angry and miserable i think my countrymen out here must be mad fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly you and mr turton and perhaps mr mcbryde are the only people who showed any common politeness the rest make me perfectly ashamed and it s got worse and worse oh just what we wanted to hear and do you know doctor aziz
p00557_A,00557,A,mrs moore says he is so nice
p00558_A,00558,A,indeed it will and that morning we go to this indian lady s all the nice things are coming thursday
p00559_A,00559,A,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00560_A,00560,A,i do so hate mysteries
p00561_A,00561,A,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00562_A,00562,A,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon
p00563_A,00563,A,i don t know
p00564_A,00564,A,i shall walk
p00565_A,00565,A,ought i to join them
p00566_A,00566,A,but where am i to go in it
p00567_A,00567,A,a sort of interview have you any explanation of my extraordinary behaviour
p00568_A,00568,A,why indeed
p00569_A,00569,A,i don t expect gratitude i only thought you might care to hear what i have to say
p00570_A,00570,A,would it not interest you to hear my side
p00571_A,00571,A,i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it
p00572_A,00572,A,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps
p00573_A,00573,A,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house
p00574_A,00574,A,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made
p00575_A,00575,A,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere
p00576_A,00576,A,will it
p00577_A,00577,A,do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask
p00578_A,00578,A,how can that be
p00579_A,00579,A,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost
p00580_A,00580,A,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does
p00581_A,00581,A,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son
p00582_A,00582,A,because the dead don t live again
p00583_A,00583,A,so do i what does dr aziz say of me
p00584_A,00584,A,the guide
p00585_A,00585,A,perhaps it was the guide
p00586_A,00586,A,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00587_A,00587,A,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00588_A,00588,A,he may not even know i m here
p00589_A,00589,A,perfectly right
p00590_A,00590,A,mr fielding has ronny told you of this new misfortune ah me
p00591_A,00591,A,i do so long to be alone she was my best friend far more to me than to him i can t bear to be with ronny i can t explain could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop after all
p00592_A,00592,A,i didn t ask him we are too much upset it s so complex not like what unhappiness is supposed to be each of us ought to be alone and think do come and see ronny again
p00593_A,00593,A,of course i ought to have thought of it myself my instincts never help me why didn t i rush up to him after the trial yes of course i will write him an apology but please will you dictate it shall i write another nothing matters if i can undo the harm i have caused i can do this right and that right but when the two are put together they come wrong that s the defect of my character i have never realized it until now i thought that if i was just and asked questions i would come through every difficulty
p00594_A,00594,A,far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced
p00595_A,00595,A,i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of
p00596_A,00596,A,no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it
p00597_A,00597,A,let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know
p00598_A,00598,A,telepathy possibly
p00599_A,00599,A,i shall often you have been excessively kind now that i m going i realize it i wish i could do something for you in return but i see you ve all you want
p00600_A,00600,A,of course this death has been troubling me
p00601_A,00601,A,but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real
p00602_A,00602,A,so do i
p00603_A,00603,A,i m glad for i like you let s meet again
p00604_A,00604,A,but i suppose you re not likely to do that yet
p00605_A,00605,A,i m rather a hermit you know
p00606_A,00606,A,owing to my work and so on i don t get up much to the club
p00607_A,00607,A,do you care to meet one or two
p00608_A,00608,A,i know all about him i don t know him would you like him asked too
p00609_A,00609,A,very well miss quested will thursday suit you
p00610_A,00610,A,i won t ask the city magistrate to bring you i know he ll be busy at that time
p00611_A,00611,A,some misunderstanding
p00612_A,00612,A,i wouldn t worry about that
p00613_A,00613,A,that s a notion
p00614_A,00614,A,we english do
p00615_A,00615,A,even mangoes can be got in england now they ship them in ice cold rooms you can make india in england apparently just as you can make england in india
p00616_A,00616,A,i suppose so
p00617_A,00617,A,good bye mrs moore
p00618_A,00618,A,what do you want here where are you going miss quested
p00619_A,00619,A,you can t wander about like that where s the car you came in
p00620_A,00620,A,what madness there s supposed to be a riot on the police have struck no one knows what ll happen next why don t you keep to your own people
p00621_A,00621,A,i m coming back this way and don t argue excuse manners but i don t know anyone s position send my carriage back any time to morrow if you please
p00622_A,00622,A,none why make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it
p00623_A,00623,A,i ought to feel grateful to you i suppose but
p00624_A,00624,A,oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair
p00625_A,00625,A,not much
p00626_A,00626,A,what kind of illness that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination
p00627_A,00627,A,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts
p00628_A,00628,A,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too
p00629_A,00629,A,you put it honestly anyhow
p00630_A,00630,A,it ll get us to heaven
p00631_A,00631,A,if heaven existed
p00632_A,00632,A,i do not yet i believe that honesty gets us there
p00633_A,00633,A,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down
p00634_A,00634,A,i don t go to that length
p00635_A,00635,A,she s an old lady
p00636_A,00636,A,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter
p00637_A,00637,A,i fear not
p00638_A,00638,A,he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else
p00639_A,00639,A,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them
p00640_A,00640,A,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district
p00641_A,00641,A,at once
p00642_A,00642,A,gladly in a minute
p00643_A,00643,A,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested
p00644_A,00644,A,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00645_A,00645,A,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p00646_A,00646,A,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00647_A,00647,A,i should be pleased but does mr heaslop wish it
p00648_A,00648,A,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00649_A,00649,A,i shall go round at once
p00650_A,00650,A,not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical
p00651_A,00651,A,i no longer want love
p00652_A,00652,A,but to go back to our first talk for i suppose this is our last one when you entered that cave who did follow you or did no one follow you can you now say i don t like it left in air
p00653_A,00653,A,how could she have known what we don t
p00654_A,00654,A,write to me when you get to england
p00655_A,00655,A,i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am
p00656_A,00656,A,aziz was so fond of her too
p00657_A,00657,A,don t let it become too real or you ll die yourself that is the objection to meditating upon death we are subdued to what we work in i have felt the same temptation and had to sheer off i want to go on living a bit
p00658_A,00658,A,and i do like you so very much if i may say so
p00659_A,00659,A,we will in england if i ever take home leave
p00660_A,00660,A,quite a chance i have a scheme on now as a matter of fact
p00661_A,00661,A,if one couldn t see the laughable side of these people one ld be done for
p00662_A,00662,A,oh nancy how topping oh nancy how killing i wish i could look at things like that
p00663_A,00663,A,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p00664_A,00664,A,what can you expect from the fellow no grits no guts
p00665_A,00665,A,bust in front of the cow hospital did it and how did you come to be there
p00666_A,00666,A,oh lord oh lord when i live here and you live there not ten minutes from me and the cow hospital is right ever so far away the other side of you there then how did you come to be passing the cow hospital on the way to me now do some work for a change
p00667_A,00667,A,sir excuse me i did i mounted my bike and it bust in front of the cow hospital so i had to find a tonga
p00668_A,00668,A,i beg your pardon
p00669_A,00669,A,disaster may come but we shall at all events get there safe even if we do not get back it will i think create a good impression should two doctors arrive at the same time
p00670_A,00670,A,dr aziz dr aziz where you been i waited ten full minutes time at your house then i went
p00671_A,00671,A,post office do you not send your servants
p00672_A,00672,A,your servant spoke to me i saw your servant
p00673_A,00673,A,even if this so what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go farther away or mine will start out of sympathy it has been so rough and wild this afternoon it spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club garden and had to be dragged back by four men english ladies and gentlemen looking on and the collector sahib himself taking a note but dr aziz i ll not take up your valuable time this will not interest you who have so many engagements and telegrams i am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when i was asked and where i was asked your absence i may remark drew commentaries
p00674_A,00674,A,it is fine to be young damn well oh very fine damn whom
p00675_A,00675,A,h morrhoids
p00676_A,00676,A,it is not the end of time it is scarcely ten thirty ha ha gentlemen if i may be allowed to say a few words what an interesting talk also thankfulness and gratitude to mr fielding in the first place teaches our sons and gives them all the great benefits of his experience and judgment
p00677_A,00677,A,dr aziz

p00707_A,00707,A,two ladies are coming to tea to meet you i think you know them
p00708_A,00708,A,not mrs moore and miss quested
p00709_A,00709,A,miss quested
p00710_A,00710,A,you can talk to miss quested about the peacock throne if you like she s artistic they say
p00711_A,00711,A,post impressionism indeed come along to tea this world is getting too much for me altogether
p00712_A,00712,A,besides the ladies i am expecting one of my assistants narayan godbole
p00713_A,00713,A,he wants the past back too but not precisely alamgir
p00714_A,00714,A,why don t you fellows run a club in chandrapore aziz
p00715_A,00715,A,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p00716_A,00716,A,well are you
p00717_A,00717,A,you re sure i don t tire you by stopping
p00718_A,00718,A,anyhow you want to rest
p00719_A,00719,A,callendar doesn t trust anyone english or indian that s his character and i wish you weren t under him but you are and that s that
p00720_A,00720,A,yes
p00721_A,00721,A,who is this
p00722_A,00722,A,really i don t know why you pay me this great compliment aziz but i do appreciate it
p00723_A,00723,A,you would have allowed me to see her
p00724_A,00724,A,did she think they were your brothers
p00725_A,00725,A,and when the whole world behaves as such there will be no more purdah
p00726_A,00726,A,it s beginning at the wrong end isn t it i know but institutions and the governments don t
p00727_A,00727,A,how did you like the two ladies you met last thursday how do you like englishwomen generally
p00728_A,00728,A,hamidullah s right they are much nicer in england there s something that doesn t suit them out here
p00729_A,00729,A,because i have more or less come through without it i was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if i can make it interesting enough the lady i liked wouldn t marry me that is the main point but that s fifteen years ago and now means nothing
p00730_A,00730,A,none
p00731_A,00731,A,no i d willingly tell you if i had
p00732_A,00732,A,it must
p00733_A,00733,A,i don t care for children
p00734_A,00734,A,i don t feel their absence i don t want them weeping around my death bed and being polite about me afterwards which i believe is the general notion i d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child other people can have children no obligation with england getting so chock a block and overrunning india for jobs
p00735_A,00735,A,good god why the girl s a prig
p00736_A,00736,A,oh i don t know her but she struck me as one of the more pathetic products of western education she depresses me
p00737_A,00737,A,she goes on and on as if she s at a lecture trying ever so hard to understand india and life and occasionally taking a note
p00738_A,00738,A,so she probably is but i can t marry her if i wanted to for she has just become engaged to the city magistrate
p00739_A,00739,A,it s the old mother s doing she was afraid her dear boy would choose for himself so she brought out the girl on purpose and flung them together until it happened
p00740_A,00740,A,i may have got it wrong i m out of club gossip but anyhow they re engaged to be married
p00741_A,00741,A,no you won t
p00742_A,00742,A,to whom
p00743_A,00743,A,thanks for telling me that yes i must try and be more careful if i m interested i m apt to forget myself still it doesn t do real harm
p00744_A,00744,A,it s often done so in the past
p00745_A,00745,A,if i do i do i shall survive it i travel light
p00746_A,00746,A,plenty of indians travel light too saddhus and such it s one of the things i admire about your country any man can travel light until he has a wife or children that s part of my case against marriage i m a holy man minus the holiness hand that on to your three spies and tell them to put it in their pipes i can t be sacked from my job because my job s education i believe in teaching people to be individuals and to understand other individuals it s the only thing i do believe in at government college i mix it up with trigonometry and so on when i m a saddhu i shall mix it up with something else you might tell your servant to bring my horse he doesn t seem to appreciate my urdu
p00747_A,00747,A,very much
p00748_A,00748,A,i never can be in trouble
p00749_A,00749,A,godbole s pujah did it
p00750_A,00750,A,i m all right you re all right don t worry
p00751_A,00751,A,aziz can i have a drink
p00752_A,00752,A,here s luck but chin chin i do refuse here s to india
p00753_A,00753,A,chandrapore the man s made a mistake
p00754_A,00754,A,he has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic
p00755_A,00755,A,aziz exactly where and how did you leave miss quested
p00756_A,00756,A,but how i suppose the guide helped her
p00757_A,00757,A,is there a path off the top
p00758_A,00758,A,but you saw them get down safe
p00759_A,00759,A,then the guide came back to you
p00760_A,00760,A,i hope she wasn t ill
p00761_A,00761,A,yes that sounds sense
p00762_A,00762,A,aziz have you figured out what this picnic will cost you
p00763_A,00763,A,i told you he s no good
p00764_A,00764,A,aziz how monstrous
p00765_A,00765,A,my proverbs are a penny saved is a penny earned a stitch in time saves nine look before you leap and the british empire rests on them you will never kick us out you know until you cease employing m l s and such
p00766_A,00766,A,but you do you take them to a picnic
p00767_A,00767,A,oh for god s sake dear fellow we re coming to mcbryde together and enquire what s gone wrong he s a decent fellow it s all unintentional he ll apologize never never act the criminal
p00768_A,00768,A,you can t it s too late how are you to get round to the private entrance now come this way with me quick i ll put you into my carriage
p00769_A,00769,A,aziz are you awake
p00770_A,00770,A,i am useless at dreaming
p00771_A,00771,A,are you
p00772_A,00772,A,there ll be a general move at chandrapore
p00773_A,00773,A,they can t well move me down whatever their feelings
p00774_A,00774,A,you have won a great victory
p00775_A,00775,A,including knowing me
p00776_A,00776,A,yes certainly you must let off miss quested easily she must pay all your costs that is only fair but do not treat her like a conquered enemy
p00777_A,00777,A,the sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited they would ruin her they are perfectly preposterous look here
p00778_A,00778,A,in the course of a long talk with miss quested
p00779_A,00779,A,be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one
p00780_A,00780,A,she ll apologize if that s the trouble look i ll make you an offer dictate to me whatever form of words you like and this time to morrow i ll bring it back signed this is not instead of any public apology she may make you in law it s an addition
p00781_A,00781,A,well good night good night it s time to go to sleep after that
p00782_A,00782,A,oh i wish you wouldn t make that kind of remark it is the one thing in you i can t put up with
p00783_A,00783,A,well you hurt me by saying it good night
p00784_A,00784,A,let us discuss that to morrow morning
p00785_A,00785,A,to whom
p00786_A,00786,A,i have not heard of other children
p00787_A,00787,A,i knew her so slightly
p00788_A,00788,A,you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz
p00789_A,00789,A,i should have thought you could it sounds common sense you can t eat your cake and have it even in the world of the spirit
p00790_A,00790,A,your unfairness is worse than my materialism
p00791_A,00791,A,if you want to reward me let miss quested off paying
p00792_A,00792,A,not very listen to mine at the conference it was settled
p00793_A,00793,A,they would say that
p00794_A,00794,A,don t bother miss quested has cleared out at last
p00795_A,00795,A,don t use such exaggerated phrases
p00796_A,00796,A,as dismay and anxiety
p00797_A,00797,A,yes but the scale the scale you always get the scale wrong my dear fellow a pity there is this rumour but such a very small pity so small that we may as well talk of something else
p00798_A,00798,A,as far as i do mind i travel light
p00799_A,00799,A,what enemies
p00800_A,00800,A,now what is the matter
p00801_A,00801,A,it simply doesn t affect me spies are as thick as mosquitoes but it s years before i shall meet the one that kills me you ve something else in your mind
p00802_A,00802,A,you have you re cross with me about something or other
p00803_A,00803,A,you little rotter well i m damned amusement indeed is it likely at such a time
p00804_A,00804,A,you see aziz the circumstances also the girl was still engaged to heaslop also i never felt
p00805_A,00805,A,you re not offended
p00806_A,00806,A,if you are this must be cleared up later on
p00807_A,00807,A,but the way i said it must be cleared up i was unintentionally rude unreserved regrets
p00808_A,00808,A,oh leave it alone like all gossip it s merely one of those half alive things that try to crowd out real life take no notice it ll vanish like poor old mrs moore s tombs
p00809_A,00809,A,we ll discuss m l at dinner
p00810_A,00810,A,bring das to me
p00811_A,00811,A,in other words probably never for i am going quite soon to england
p00812_A,00812,A,i am only going for a little time on official business my service is anxious to get me away from chandrapore for a bit it is obliged to value me highly but does not care for me the situation is somewhat humorous
p00813_A,00813,A,enough to see my friends
p00814_A,00814,A,willingly what subject
p00815_A,00815,A,let us talk about poetry you people are sadly circumstanced whatever are you to write about you cannot say for evermore we know it s faded yet you can t have patriotic poetry of the india my india type when it s nobody s india
p00816_A,00816,A,you are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life when i knew you first you used it as an incantation
p00817_A,00817,A,i hoped you would be
p00818_A,00818,A,there is something in religion that may not be true but has not yet been sung
p00819_A,00819,A,something that the hindus have perhaps found
p00820_A,00820,A,hindus are unable to sing
p00821_A,00821,A,we haven t discussed poetry for two seconds
p00822_A,00822,A,if i have time it will be strange seeing her in hampstead
p00823_A,00823,A,an artistic and thoughtful little suburb of london
p00824_A,00824,A,when would you like the carriage
p00825_A,00825,A,but you haven t got your bicycle my carriage fetched you let it take you away
p00826_A,00826,A,aziz you have forgiven me the stupid remark i made this morning
p00827_A,00827,A,yes to my eternal confusion you know how fond i am of you
p00828_A,00828,A,how do you do aziz after all this time i heard you were settled in here i suppose a couple of stings don t signify
p00829_A,00829,A,why have you not answered my letters is there a short cut down to our carriage we must give up our walk the weather s pestilential
p00830_A,00830,A,are you not coming down yourself how goes it aziz
p00831_A,00831,A,are you making anything out of your life here
p00832_A,00832,A,who is in charge of the guest house
p00833_A,00833,A,where is he then
p00834_A,00834,A,because not a soul s been near us since we arrived
p00835_A,00835,A,i wrote beforehand to the durbar and asked if a visit was convenient i was told it was and arranged my tour accordingly but the guest house servants appear to have no definite instructions we can t get any eggs also my wife wants to go out in the boat
p00836_A,00836,A,exactly and no oars
p00837_A,00837,A,all four
p00838_A,00838,A,if the weather lifts we want to see your torchlight procession from the water this evening i wrote to godbole about it but he has taken no notice it s a place of the dead
p00839_A,00839,A,will there be any objection to english people watching the procession
p00840_A,00840,A,we had a very different reception both at mudkul and deora they were kindness itself at deora the maharajah and maharani wanted us to see everything
p00841_A,00841,A,jump in ralph
p00842_A,00842,A,who on earth is mr quested
p00843_A,00843,A,quested quested don t you know that my wife was mrs moore s daughter perhaps this explains your odd attitude
p00844_A,00844,A,the preposterous letter you allowed mahmoud ali to write for you
p00845_A,00845,A,however did you make such a mistake it s almost unbelievable i should think i wrote you half a dozen times mentioning my wife by name miss quested what an extraordinary notion miss quested is our best friend she introduced us but what an amazing notion aziz we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on it is clearly some devilry of mahmoud ali s he knows perfectly well i married miss moore he called her heaslop s sister in his insolent letter to me
p00846_A,00846,A,if you won t talk about the marabar to stella why won t you talk to ralph he is a wise boy really and same metaphor he rides a little behind her though with her
p00847_A,00847,A,no we won t think about it from her point of view mau has been a success it calmed her both of them suffer from restlessness she found something soothing some solution of her queer troubles here do you know anything about this krishna business
p00848_A,00848,A,gokul is the village where krishna was born well more or less born for there s the same hovering between it and another village as between bethlehem and nazareth what i want to discover is its spiritual side if it has one
p00849_A,00849,A,it s difficult to explain i never really understood or liked them except an occasional scrap of godbole does the old fellow still say
p00850_A,00850,A,i can t explain because it isn t in words at all but why do my wife and her brother like hinduism though they take no interest in its forms they won t talk to me about this they know i think a certain side of their lives is a mistake and are shy that s why i wish you would talk to them for at all events you re oriental
p00851_A,00851,A,no further use for politeness
p00852_A,00852,A,away from us indians go to seed at once look at the king emperor high school look at you forgetting your medicine and going back to charms look at your poems
p00853_A,00853,A,yes and what do they say free our women and india will be free try it my lad free your own lady in the first place and see who ll wash ahmed karim and jamila s faces a nice situation
p00854_A,00854,A,who do you want instead of the english the japanese
p00855_A,00855,A,oh your hindu friends will like that won t they
p00856_A,00856,A,it will indeed be arranged
p00857_A,00857,A,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00858_A,00858,A,of course of course you know me
p00859_A,00859,A,i have been here such a short time and always in the bazaar no wonder you have never seen me and i wonder you know my name i say mr fielding
p00860_A,00860,A,guess what i look like before you come out that will be a kind of game
p00861_A,00861,A,jolly good what next have i not a venerable white beard
p00862_A,00862,A,anything wrong
p00863_A,00863,A,take mine take mine
p00864_A,00864,A,yes yes one minute
p00865_A,00865,A,no no one in my pocket here it is
p00866_A,00866,A,one minute again
p00867_A,00867,A,but i always thought that englishmen kept their rooms so tidy it seems that this is not so i need not be so ashamed everything ranged coldly on shelves was what i thought i say mr fielding is the stud going to go in
p00868_A,00868,A,what s that last sentence please will you teach me some new words and so improve my english let me put in your stud i see the shirt back s hole is rather small and to rip it wider a pity
p00869_A,00869,A,we wear them to pass the police
p00870_A,00870,A,if i m biking in english dress starch collar hat with ditch they take no notice when i wear a fez they cry your lamp s out lord curzon did not consider this when he urged natives of india to retain their picturesque costumes hooray stud s gone in sometimes i shut my eyes and dream i have splendid clothes again and am riding into battle behind alamgir mr fielding must not india have been beautiful then with the mogul empire at its height and alamgir reigning at delhi upon the peacock throne
p00871_A,00871,A,meet me i know no ladies
p00872_A,00872,A,oh yes i remember an excessively aged lady but will you please repeat the name of her companion
p00873_A,00873,A,just as you wish
p00874_A,00874,A,is she a post impressionist
p00875_A,00875,A,i do not consider mrs moore my friend i only met her accidentally in my mosque a single meeting is too short to make a friend
p00876_A,00876,A,oho the deccani brahman
p00877_A,00877,A,i should think not do you know what deccani brahmans say that england conquered india from them from them mind and not from the moguls is not that like their cheek they have even bribed it to appear in text books for they are so subtle and immensely rich professor godbole must be quite unlike all other deccani brahmans from all i can hear say a most sincere chap
p00878_A,00878,A,slack hindus they have no idea of society i know them very well because of a doctor at the hospital such a slack unpunctual fellow it is as well you did not go to their house for it would give you a wrong idea of india nothing sanitary i think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send
p00879_A,00879,A,mangoes mangoes
p00880_A,00880,A,no doubt major callendar has told you that i am shamming
p00881_A,00881,A,enquire from dr panna lal
p00882_A,00882,A,here s your home here s the celebrated hospitality of the east look at the flies look at the chunam coming off the walls isn t it jolly now i suppose you want to be off having seen an oriental interior
p00883_A,00883,A,i can rest the whole day thanks to worthy dr lal major callendar s spy i suppose you know but this time it didn t work i am allowed to have a slight temperature
p00884_A,00884,A,before you go for you are evidently in a great hurry will you please unlock that drawer do you see a piece of brown paper at the top
p00885_A,00885,A,open it
p00886_A,00886,A,she was my wife you are the first englishman she has ever come before now put her photograph away
p00887_A,00887,A,oh it s nothing she was not a highly educated woman or even beautiful but put it away you would have seen her so why should you not see her photograph
p00888_A,00888,A,why not i believe in the purdah but i should have told her you were my brother and she would have seen you hamidullah saw her and several others
p00889_A,00889,A,of course not but the word exists and is convenient all men are my brothers and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife
p00890_A,00890,A,it is because you can say and feel such a remark as that that i show you the photograph it is beyond the power of most men it is because you behave well while i behave badly that i show it you i never expected you to come back just now when i called you i thought mr fielding no one can ever realize how much kindness we indians need we do not even realize it ourselves but we know when it has been given we do not forget though we may seem to kindness more kindness and even after that more kindness i assure you it is the only hope we can t build up india except on what we feel what is the use of all these reforms and conciliation committees for mohurram and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry it another route and councils of notables and official parties where the english sneer at our skins
p00891_A,00891,A,put her away she is of no importance she is dead i showed her to you because i have nothing else to show you may look round the whole of my bungalow now and empty everything i have no other secrets my three children live away with their grandmamma and that is all
p00892_A,00892,A,hamidullah liked them in england here we never look at them oh no much too careful let s talk of something else
p00893_A,00893,A,why are you not married
p00894_A,00894,A,but you haven t children
p00895_A,00895,A,excuse the following question have you any illegitimate children
p00896_A,00896,A,then your name will entirely die out
p00897_A,00897,A,well this indifference is what the oriental will never understand
p00898_A,00898,A,caring has nothing to do with it
p00899_A,00899,A,why don t you marry miss quested
p00900_A,00900,A,prig prig kindly explain isn t that a bad word
p00901_A,00901,A,but prig mr fielding how s that
p00902_A,00902,A,i thought her so nice and sincere
p00903_A,00903,A,has she indeed i am so glad
p00904_A,00904,A,mrs moore did not mention that to me among her plans
p00905_A,00905,A,yes you re out of it my poor chap no miss quested for mr fielding however she was not beautiful she has practically no breasts if you come to think of it for the city magistrate they shall be sufficient perhaps and he for her for you i shall arrange a lady with breasts like mangoes
p00906_A,00906,A,i will not really and besides your position makes it dangerous for you you can t be too careful in every way mr fielding whatever you say or do in this damned country there is always some envious fellow on the look out you may be surprised to know that there were at least three spies sitting here when you came to enquire i was really a good deal upset that you talked in that fashion about god they will certainly report it
p00907_A,00907,A,that s all very well but you spoke against morality also and you said you had come to take other people s jobs all that was very unwise this is an awful place for scandal why actually one of your own pupils was listening
p00908_A,00908,A,but speaking out may get you into trouble
p00909_A,00909,A,there listen to that but the end of it might be that you lost your job
p00910_A,00910,A,travel light you are a most extraordinary race is it your climate or what
p00911_A,00911,A,i know i gave him orders not to such are the tricks we play on unfortunate englishmen poor mr fielding but i will release you now oh dear with the exception of yourself and hamidullah i have no one to talk to in this place you like hamidullah don t you

p00916_A,00916,A,oh no why
p00917_A,00917,A,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness
p00918_A,00918,A,up there

p00924_A,00924,A,i see you re worrying let s talk of other things miss quested was always to do what she wished it was our arrangement i see you are worrying on my account but really i don t mind i never notice trifles
p00925_A,00925,A,sh my dear chap don t mention that part hundreds and hundreds of rupees the completed account will be too awful my friends servants have robbed me right and left and as for an elephant she apparently eats gold i can trust you not to repeat this and m l please employ initials he listens is far the worst of all
p00926_A,00926,A,he is plenty of good for himself his dishonesty will ruin me
p00927_A,00927,A,i am delighted with him really he has made my guests comfortable besides it is my duty to employ him he is my cousin if money goes money comes if money stays death comes did you ever hear that useful urdu proverb probably not for i have just invented it
p00928_A,00928,A,oh kick you out why should i trouble over that dirty job leave it to the politicians no when i was a student i got excited over your damned countrymen certainly but if they ll let me get on with my profession and not be too rude to me officially i really don t ask for more

p00933_A,00933,A,except that i ate too much i say panna lal and callendar ll get the sack
p00934_A,00934,A,and you ll get promotion
p00935_A,00935,A,in any case we spend our holidays together and visit kashmir possibly persia for i shall have plenty of money paid to me on account of the injury sustained by my character while with me you shall never spend a single pie this is what i have always wished and as the result of my misfortunes it has come
p00936_A,00936,A,i know my dear chap i know your voice need not become so solemn and anxious i know what you are going to say next let oh let miss quested off paying so that the english may say the approval of your compatriots no longer interests me i have become anti british and ought to have done so sooner it would have saved me numerous misfortunes
p00937_A,00937,A,i say shall we go and pour water on to mohammed latif s face he is so funny when this is done to him asleep
p00938_A,00938,A,is she wealthy i depute you to find out
p00939_A,00939,A,i am looking though it gets a bit dark i see cyril fielding to be a very nice chap indeed and my best friend but in some ways a fool you think that by letting miss quested off easily i shall make a better reputation for myself and indians generally no no it will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion officially i have decided to have nothing more to do with british india as a matter of fact i shall seek service in some moslem state such as hyderabad bhopal where englishmen cannot insult me any more don t counsel me otherwise
p00940_A,00940,A,i don t want to hear your long talks
p00941_A,00941,A,not even mogul emperors showed mercy until they received an apology
p00942_A,00942,A,will she sign that
p00943_A,00943,A,good night i suppose it is
p00944_A,00944,A,i put up with all things in you so what is to be done
p00945_A,00945,A,cyril i have had an idea which will satisfy your tender mind i shall consult mrs moore her opinion will solve everything i can trust her so absolutely if she advises me to pardon this girl i shall do so she will counsel me nothing against my real and true honour as you might
p00946_A,00946,A,is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella
p00947_A,00947,A,to those other children
p00948_A,00948,A,just as i have two boys and a girl so has mrs moore she told me in the mosque
p00949_A,00949,A,i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental
p00950_A,00950,A,is emotion a sack of potatoes so much the pound to be measured out am i a machine i shall be told i can use up my emotions by using them next
p00951_A,00951,A,if you are right there is no point in any friendship it all comes down to give and take or give and return which is disgusting and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow so materialistic
p00952_A,00952,A,i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time
p00953_A,00953,A,i do not believe him
p00954_A,00954,A,give in to the east you can trust me cyril can t you see that i m grateful to you for your help and want to reward you
p00955_A,00955,A,that pure minded fellow however he will blame the indian climate everything is our fault really now have i not discovered an important piece of news for you cyril
p00956_A,00956,A,this evening will do for schoolmastery i should go straight to the minto now the cholera looks bad we begin to have local cases as well as imported in fact the whole of life is somewhat sad the new civil surgeon is the same as the last but does not yet dare to be that is all any administrative change amounts to all my suffering has won nothing for us but look here cyril while i remember it there s gossip about you as well as mcbryde they say that you and miss quested became also rather too intimate friends to speak perfectly frankly they say you and she have been guilty of impropriety
p00957_A,00957,A,it s all over the town and may injure your reputation you know everyone is by no means your supporter i have tried all i could to silence such a story
p00958_A,00958,A,it is those who stop in the country not those who leave it whom such a story injures imagine my dismay and anxiety i could scarcely get a wink of sleep first my name was coupled with her and now it is yours
p00959_A,00959,A,as what
p00960_A,00960,A,have i not lived all my life in india do i not know what produces a bad impression here
p00961_A,00961,A,you mind for miss quested s sake though i can see from your face
p00962_A,00962,A,cyril that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin it is raising up enemies against you on all sides and makes me feel excessively uneasy
p00963_A,00963,A,i have given you list after list of the people who cannot be trusted in this city in your position i should have the sense to know i was surrounded by enemies you observe i speak in a low voice it is because i see your sais is new how do i know he isn t a spy every third servant is a spy
p00964_A,00964,A,do you contradict my last remark
p00965_A,00965,A,i ve not don t be ridiculous
p00966_A,00966,A,so you and madamsell adela used to amuse one another in the evening naughty boy
p00967_A,00967,A,oh i beg your pardon i m sure the licentious oriental imagination was at work
p00968_A,00968,A,yes yes but you didn t contradict what i said so i thought it was true oh dear east and west most misleading will you please put your little rotter down at his hospital
p00969_A,00969,A,most certainly i am not
p00970_A,00970,A,it has been i believe absolutely what you say and of that there need be no further question
p00971_A,00971,A,the fault is entirely mine but i believe you i believe mohammed latif shall be severely punished for inventing this
p00972_A,00972,A,mohammed latif has taken to intriguing we are already much displeased with him will it satisfy you if we send him back to his family without a present
p00973_A,00973,A,dinner this is most unlucky i forgot i have promised to dine with das

p01025_A,01025,A,i want you to explain a disappointment we had this morning it must be some point of indian etiquette
p01026_A,01026,A,exactly what mr heaslop tells me if one doesn t worry how s one to understand
p01027_A,01027,A,i m afraid i can t do that

p01032_A,01032,A,thank you

p01044_A,01044,A,not at all we enjoy talk like this very much
p01045_A,01045,A,tell us something about akbar
p01046_A,01046,A,but wasn t akbar s new religion very fine it was to embrace the whole of india
p01047_A,01047,A,oh do you feel that dr aziz i hope you re not right there will have to be something universal in this country i don t say religion for i m not religious but something or how else are barriers to be broken down take my own case i don t know whether you happen to have heard but i m going to marry mr heaslop
p01048_A,01048,A,ah that s true well by marrying mr heaslop i shall become what is known as an anglo indian
p01049_A,01049,A,but i shall it s inevitable i can t avoid the label what i do hope to avoid is the mentality women like some women are so well ungenerous and snobby about indians and i should feel too ashamed for words if i turned like them but and here s my difficulty there s nothing special about me nothing specially good or strong which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them i ve most lamentable defects that s why i want akbar s universal religion or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible do you see what i mean
p01050_A,01050,A,oh my happiness that s quite another problem i want to consult you about this anglo indian difficulty can you give me any advice
p01051_A,01051,A,i am told we all get rude after a year
p01052_A,01052,A,no i m all right thanks are you married dr aziz

p01058_A,01058,A,then back with water streaming over you and perhaps rather a pain inside but i did not mind all my friends were paining with me we have a proverb in urdu what does unhappiness matter when we are all unhappy together which comes in conveniently after mangoes miss quested do wait for mangoes why not settle altogether in india
p01059_A,01059,A,miss quested professor godbole s sweets are delicious they will give you a real indian treat ah in my poor position i can give you nothing
p01060_A,01060,A,yes all that is settled i invite you all to see me in the marabar caves
p01061_A,01061,A,i know
p01062_A,01062,A,good bye mrs moore
p01063_A,01063,A,good bye miss quested you ll jolly jolly well not forget those caves won t you i ll fix the whole show up in a jiffy
p01064_A,01064,A,what a shame you leave india so soon oh do reconsider your decision do stay
p01065_A,01065,A,send back your servant he is unnecessary then we shall all be moslems together
p01066_A,01066,A,i am to blame i am the host
p01067_A,01067,A,mohammed latif by the way what is in these caves brother why are we all going to see them
p01068_A,01068,A,good morning good morning put on your topis put on your topis at once the early sun is highly dangerous for heads i speak as a doctor
p01069_A,01069,A,not for my thick head
p01070_A,01070,A,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p01071_A,01071,A,i thought we would eat this before our caves and breakfast after
p01072_A,01072,A,this breakfast did you think i should treat you so strangely
p01073_A,01073,A,friendships last longest that begin like that i think shall i ever entertain your other children
p01074_A,01074,A,ralph and stella yes i know everything about them but we must not forget to visit our caves one of the dreams of my life is accomplished in having you both here as my guests you cannot imagine how you have honoured me i feel like the emperor babur
p01075_A,01075,A,because my ancestors came down with him from afghanistan they joined him at herat he also had often no more elephants than one none sometimes but he never ceased showing hospitality when he fought or hunted or ran away he would always stop for a time among hills just like us he would never let go of hospitality and pleasure and if there was only a little food he would have it arranged nicely and if only one musical instrument he would compel it to play a beautiful tune i take him as my ideal he is the poor gentleman and he became a great king
p01076_A,01076,A,alamgir oh yes he was of course the more pious but babur never in his whole life did he betray a friend so i can only think of him this morning and you know how he died he laid down his life for his son a death far more difficult than battle they were caught in the heat they should have gone back to kabul for the bad weather but could not for reasons of state and at agra humayun fell sick babur walked round the bed three times and said and he did bear it away the fever left his son and came to him instead and he died that is why i prefer babur to alamgir i ought not to do so but i do however i mustn t delay you i see you are ready to start
p01077_A,01077,A,i always enjoy conversing about the moguls it is the chief pleasure i know you see those first six emperors were all most wonderful men and as soon as one of them is mentioned no matter which i forget everything else in the world except the other five you could not find six such kings in all the countries of the earth not i mean coming one after the other father son
p01078_A,01078,A,ah you have heard the name of akbar good hamidullah whom you shall meet will tell you that akbar is the greatest of all i say which makes hamidullah cry but babur always repented afterwards which makes the entire difference and akbar never repented of the new religion he invented instead of the holy koran
p01079_A,01079,A,miss quested fine but foolish you keep your religion i mine that is the best nothing embraces the whole of india nothing nothing and that was akbar s mistake
p01080_A,01080,A,on which my heartiest congratulations
p01081_A,01081,A,impossible take back such a terrible remark
p01082_A,01082,A,you are certain to be happy with any relative of mrs moore s
p01083_A,01083,A,you are absolutely unlike the others i assure you you will never be rude to my people
p01084_A,01084,A,then you are told a lie come along
p01085_A,01085,A,pretty sure they should come on some interesting old carvings soon
p01086_A,01086,A,do i take you too fast
p01087_A,01087,A,yes indeed do come and see my wife
p01088_A,01088,A,she is not in chandrapore just now
p01089_A,01089,A,yes indeed three
p01090_A,01090,A,why naturally i adore them i suppose so
p01091_A,01091,A,an indian lady and gentleman were to send their carriage for us this morning at nine it has never come we waited and waited and waited we can t think what happened
p01092_A,01092,A,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p01093_A,01093,A,oh do you think so mr fielding
p01094_A,01094,A,good bye mr fielding and thank you so much what lovely college buildings
p01095_A,01095,A,he s not to he ll kill himself

p01097_A,01097,A,mr fielding have you seen miss quested
p01098_A,01098,A,miss derek is most unsatisfactory and restless always in a hurry always wanting something new she will do anything in the world except go back to the indian lady who pays her
p01099_A,01099,A,adela she s never been in a hurry in her life
p01100_A,01100,A,i know
p01101_A,01101,A,a mystery is a muddle
p01102_A,01102,A,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p01103_A,01103,A,good bye miss quested
p01104_A,01104,A,right give a hand

p01109_A,01109,A,i say it ll prove to be miss quested s wish in fact i know it is aziz is a charming fellow
p01110_A,01110,A,visitors like you are too rare
p01111_A,01111,A,i speak now as a doctor no
p01112_A,01112,A,they are immensely holy no doubt
p01113_A,01113,A,still they are ornamented in some way
p01114_A,01114,A,well why are they so famous we all talk of the famous marabar caves perhaps that is our empty brag
p01115_A,01115,A,describe them to this lady then
p01116_A,01116,A,hullo sorry
p01117_A,01117,A,did he since when
p01118_A,01118,A,sorry
p01119_A,01119,A,why did you not tell me your silence plunged me into a pretty pickle
p01120_A,01120,A,they are indeed such affability is seldom seen but what can we offer to detain them
p01121_A,01121,A,but i will send you up a few healthy sweets i will give myself that pleasure
p01122_A,01122,A,oh no not at all at elephanta there are sculptures of siva and parvati there are no sculptures at marabar
p01123_A,01123,A,oh no oh no
p01124_A,01124,A,oh no
p01125_A,01125,A,no i should not quite say that
p01126_A,01126,A,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p01127_A,01127,A,he arrived at the european guest house perhaps at least possibly
p01128_A,01128,A,ah you might make me late
p01129_A,01129,A,ah no he married the sister of mr heaslop ah exactly i have known that for over a year
p01130_A,01130,A,i shall be delighted
p01131_A,01131,A,then tell me everything you will or i shall never understand india are they the hills i sometimes see in the evening what are these caves
p01132_A,01132,A,are they large caves
p01133_A,01133,A,do describe them professor godbole
p01134_A,01134,A,something like the caves at elephanta
p01135_A,01135,A,good bye professor godbole it s a shame we never heard you sing
p01136_A,01136,A,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p01137_A,01137,A,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p01138_A,01138,A,no not large
p01139_A,01139,A,it will be a great honour there is an entrance in the rock which you enter and through the entrance is the cave
p01140_A,01140,A,not heard of them the marabar caves in the marabar hills
p01141_A,01141,A,everything s altered some soldier men have come in come along and i ll tell you about it
p01142_A,01142,A,come along up and join us mr heaslop sit down till your mother turns up he may not understand that allow me
p01143_A,01143,A,i m sorry what s up
p01144_A,01144,A,he isn t a bounder his nerves are on edge that s all
p01145_A,01145,A,i want to leave the room but cannot while this gentleman prevents me
p01146_A,01146,A,i may sing now
p01147_A,01147,A,may i now take my leave now i take my leave i must tell you how glad i am to hear that after all you succeeded in reaching the marabar i feared my unpunctuality had prevented you but you went a far pleasanter method in miss derek s car i hope the expedition was a successful one
p01148_A,01148,A,oh yes
p01149_A,01149,A,oh yes that is all round the college
p01150_A,01150,A,i cannot say i was not present
p01151_A,01151,A,so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know
p01152_A,01152,A,and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school
p01153_A,01153,A,yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known
p01154_A,01154,A,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth
p01155_A,01155,A,that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt
p01156_A,01156,A,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us
p01157_A,01157,A,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs
p01158_A,01158,A,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both
p01159_A,01159,A,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground
p01160_A,01160,A,thanks so much what was that
p01161_A,01161,A,the news has not reached you yet i can see
p01162_A,01162,A,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz
p01163_A,01163,A,well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one
p01164_A,01164,A,i am most frightfully cut up
p01165_A,01165,A,yes alas
p01166_A,01166,A,a name a name for a school
p01167_A,01167,A,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison
p01168_A,01168,A,godbole is aziz innocent or guilty
p01169_A,01169,A,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing
p01170_A,01170,A,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same
p01171_A,01171,A,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something
p01172_A,01172,A,you re preaching that evil and good are the same
p01173_A,01173,A,yes yes
p01174_A,01174,A,i will explain in detail it was a religious song i placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden i say to shri krishna the god refuses to come i grow humble and say he refuses to come this is repeated several times the song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present hour which is the evening
p01175_A,01175,A,but he comes in some other song i hope
p01176_A,01176,A,oh no he refuses to come i say to him come come come come come come he neglects to come
p01177_A,01177,A,what do i hear what most improbable statement have i heard an english lady useless no no no no no
p01178_A,01178,A,let me take you to the bungalow and first the little spin
p01179_A,01179,A,despite my advanced years i am learning to drive man can learn everything if he will but try i do not do the actual steering i sit and ask my chauffeur questions and thus learn the reason for everything that is done before i do it myself by this method serious and i may say ludicrous accidents such as befell one of my compatriots during that delightful reception at the english club are avoided our good panna lal i hope sahib that great damage was not done to your flowers let us have our little spin down the gangavati road half one league onwards
p01180_A,01180,A,i consider not to be frightened the height of folly
p01181_A,01181,A,all over oh yes the danger is past let us smoke cigarettes let us do anything we please oh yes enjoy ourselves oh my merciful god
p01182_A,01182,A,exactly too big for a goat
p01183_A,01183,A,sahib says hyena
p01184_A,01184,A,a smash sahib that would not have taken place had he obeyed and taken us gangavati side instead of marabar
p01185_A,01185,A,ah now i begin to understand
p01186_A,01186,A,hallo nawab bahadur been watching the polo again
p01187_A,01187,A,that s as you like but there s no hurry is there
p01188_A,01188,A,he may show you some aspect of the country i can t and he s a real loyalist i thought you might care for a bit of a change
p01189_A,01189,A,well it s all over now tears are useless we had some luck butting that tree
p01190_A,01190,A,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p01191_A,01191,A,don t worry mr harris he saved us from a nasty smash harris well done
p01192_A,01192,A,my fault that i told him to come this way because the road s better mr lesley has made it pukka right up to the hills

p01250_A,01250,A,when a doctor falls ill it is a serious matter
p01251_A,01251,A,that is exactly my own view
p01252_A,01252,A,when an engineer falls ill it is equally important
p01253_A,01253,A,all illness proceeds from hindus
p01254_A,01254,A,oh yes we are all jolly important our salaries prove it
p01255_A,01255,A,dr aziz took tea with our principal last thursday afternoon professor godbole who also attended has sickened too which seems rather a curious thing sir does it not

p01267_A,01267,A,that settles it in twenty four hours he will be dead
p01268_A,01268,A,sit down
p01269_A,01269,A,aziz aziz my dear boy we must be going we are already late get well quickly for i do not know what our little circle would do without you
p01270_A,01270,A,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p01271_A,01271,A,add mine to them
p01272_A,01272,A,gentlemen you will excuse i have come to enquire by major callendar s orders
p01273_A,01273,A,some he should remain in bed how is stomach how head
p01274_A,01274,A,it is only my duty
p01275_A,01275,A,yes that is true
p01276_A,01276,A,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p01277_A,01277,A,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively
p01278_A,01278,A,here he lies
p01279_A,01279,A,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p01280_A,01280,A,we know how busy you are
p01281_A,01281,A,and how much illness there is in the city
p01282_A,01282,A,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p01283_A,01283,A,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p01284_A,01284,A,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p01285_A,01285,A,dr aziz dr aziz i come to enquire your hand also please some temperature
p01286_A,01286,A,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p01287_A,01287,A,it is only a boy
p01288_A,01288,A,i think not much
p01289_A,01289,A,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p01290_A,01290,A,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p01291_A,01291,A,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p01292_A,01292,A,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p01293_A,01293,A,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p01294_A,01294,A,even boys must learn
p01295_A,01295,A,oh indeed oh yes perhaps he has not the advantage of a relative in the prosperity printing press
p01296_A,01296,A,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p01297_A,01297,A,forgive my mistakes
p01298_A,01298,A,sir i am a horse we shall be your horses
p01299_A,01299,A,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p01300_A,01300,A,oh that is true how true
p01301_A,01301,A,does mr fielding think it s true
p01302_A,01302,A,no no the existence of providence
p01303_A,01303,A,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p01304_A,01304,A,and does not morality also decline
p01305_A,01305,A,excuse the question but if this is the case how is england justified in holding india
p01306_A,01306,A,well qualified indians also need jobs in the educational
p01307_A,01307,A,then excuse me again is it fair an englishman should occupy one when indians are available of course i mean nothing personally personally we are delighted you should be here and we benefit greatly by this frank talk
p01308_A,01308,A,and those englishmen who are not delighted to be in india have they no excuse
p01309_A,01309,A,ah ah has some evidence come
p01310_A,01310,A,ah yes mr fielding but when once an indian has been arrested we do not know where it will stop you are very good to greet me in this public fashion i appreciate it but mr fielding nothing convinces a magistrate except evidence did mr mcbryde make any remark when my card came in do you think my application annoyed him will prejudice him against my friend at all if so i will gladly retire
p01311_A,01311,A,ah it s all very well for you to speak like that but we have to live in this country
p01312_A,01312,A,oh no we must hit with all our strength when i saw my friend s private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman i said to myself amritrao is the man to clear up this
p01313_A,01313,A,at a crisis the english are really unequalled
p01314_A,01314,A,good bye my dear fielding and you actually are on our side against your own people
p01315_A,01315,A,hullo my dear fielding so i run you down at last can you come out at once to dilkusha
p01316_A,01316,A,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p01317_A,01317,A,all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves
p01318_A,01318,A,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p01319_A,01319,A,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p01320_A,01320,A,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow
p01321_A,01321,A,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him
p01322_A,01322,A,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p01323_A,01323,A,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p01324_A,01324,A,oh really mrs moore i m sorry
p01325_A,01325,A,the heat i suppose
p01326_A,01326,A,may is no month to allow an old lady to travel in
p01327_A,01327,A,let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear they really are intolerable dawdling there ah well fielding you don t believe in providence i remember i do this is heaslop s punishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing our alibi
p01328_A,01328,A,she loved aziz he says also india and he loved her
p01329_A,01329,A,it is clearly to be understood sir that neither mr fielding nor any of us are responsible for this lady s safety at government college
p01330_A,01330,A,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p01331_A,01331,A,i don t believe in god
p01332_A,01332,A,the educated thoughtful people i should say so though they don t like the name the truth is that the west doesn t bother much over belief and disbelief in these days fifty years ago or even when you and i were young much more fuss was made
p01333_A,01333,A,it depends what you call yes yes i suppose morality does decline
p01334_A,01334,A,it s a question i can t get my mind on to i m out here personally because i needed a job i cannot tell you why england is here or whether she ought to be here it s beyond me
p01335_A,01335,A,i guess they do i got in first
p01336_A,01336,A,i m delighted to be here too that s my answer there s my only excuse i can t tell you anything about fairness it mayn t have been fair i should have been born i take up some other fellow s air don t i whenever i breathe still i m glad it s happened and i m glad i m out here however big a badmash one is if one s happy in consequence that is some justification
p01337_A,01337,A,none chuck em out
p01338_A,01338,A,it s all a mistake
p01339_A,01339,A,it will come
p01340_A,01340,A,he s not annoyed and if he was what does it matter
p01341_A,01341,A,first and foremost the question of bail why drag in him though
p01342_A,01342,A,don t complicate let the cards play themselves we re bound to win there s nothing else we can do she will never be able to substantiate the charge
p01343_A,01343,A,good bye then my dear hamidullah we must drop the mr now give aziz my love when you see him and tell him to keep calm calm calm i shall go back to the college now if you want me ring me up if you don t don t for i shall be very busy
p01344_A,01344,A,the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends
p01345_A,01345,A,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p01346_A,01346,A,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p01347_A,01347,A,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p01348_A,01348,A,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p01349_A,01349,A,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p01350_A,01350,A,i ll see him first if you prefer
p01351_A,01351,A,thank goodness that s over
p01352_A,01352,A,he couldn t very well after my behaviour to him at the club heaslop doesn t come out badly besides fate has treated him pretty roughly to day he has had a cable to the effect that his mother s dead poor old soul
p01353_A,01353,A,she died at sea
p01354_A,01354,A,presumably
p01355_A,01355,A,quite so heaslop ought never to have let her go and he knows it shall we be off
p01356_A,01356,A,you go rather too far there the poor old lady s evidence could have had no value shout and shriek mahmoud ali as he will she couldn t see through the kawa dol even if she had wanted to only miss quested could have saved him
p01357_A,01357,A,love is of no value in a witness as a barrister ought to know but i see there is about to be an esmiss esmoor legend at chandrapore my dear hamidullah and i will not impede its growth
p01358_A,01358,A,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p01359_A,01359,A,well i don t believe in providence
p01360_A,01360,A,but how then can you believe in god
p01361_A,01361,A,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p01362_A,01362,A,oh that is true how true
p01363_A,01363,A,i beg pardon but some might say your leg kicks
p01364_A,01364,A,aziz has a high opinion of you he only did not speak because of his illness
p01365_A,01365,A,bad bad you have destroyed me
p01366_A,01366,A,hurry up sir we pull you in a procession
p01367_A,01367,A,and he is such a horrible servant antony you can go we don t want you
p01368_A,01368,A,mistress tells you to go
p01369_A,01369,A,master told me to come
p01370_A,01370,A,master says keep near the ladies all the morning
p01371_A,01371,A,mohammed latif here is my cousin mr mohammed latif oh no don t shake hands he is an indian of the old fashioned sort he prefers to salaam there i told you so mohammed latif how beautifully you salaam see he hasn t understood he knows no english
p01372_A,01372,A,tell me another time brother when i have more leisure for now as i have already explained we have to give pleasure to non moslems three will be europeans one a hindu which must not be forgotten every attention must be paid to professor godbole lest he feel that he is inferior to my other guests
p01373_A,01373,A,that will be kind of you but the servants are even more important we must not convey an impression of disorganization it can be done and i expect you to do it
p01374_A,01374,A,you spick lie
p01375_A,01375,A,i will discuss philosophy with him
p01376_A,01376,A,merciful god
p01377_A,01377,A,oh what a surprise
p01378_A,01378,A,why haven t you gone to the marabar
p01379_A,01379,A,dr aziz it is my highly painful duty to arrest you
p01380_A,01380,A,sir they are my instructions i know nothing
p01381_A,01381,A,i am under instructions not to say
p01382_A,01382,A,sir excuse me no warrant is required under these particular circumstances refer to mr mcbryde
p01383_A,01383,A,dr aziz will you kindly come a closed conveyance stands in readiness that will compel me to use force
p01384_A,01384,A,hullo some mistake
p01385_A,01385,A,on what charge do you arrest him
p01386_A,01386,A,don t answer me like that produce your warrant
p01387_A,01387,A,very well so we will come along aziz old man nothing to fuss about some blunder
p01388_A,01388,A,nothing of the sort put your hat straight and take my arm i ll see you through
p01389_A,01389,A,the worst thing in my whole career has happened miss quested has been insulted in one of the marabar caves
p01390_A,01390,A,she escaped by god s grace
p01391_A,01391,A,i called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the police station
p01392_A,01392,A,miss derek and the victim herself miss quested herself definitely accuses him of
p01393_A,01393,A,i cannot pass that last remark you will withdraw it instantly it is the type of remark you have permitted yourself to make ever since you came to chandrapore
p01394_A,01394,A,pray mr fielding what induced you to speak to me in such a tone
p01395_A,01395,A,that that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form
p01396_A,01396,A,it does indeed rest upon a mistake it does indeed i have had twenty five years experience of this country and during those twenty five years i have never known anything but disaster result when english people and indians attempt to be intimate socially intercourse yes courtesy by all means intimacy never never the whole weight of my authority is against it i have been in charge at chandrapore for six years and if everything has gone smoothly if there has been mutual respect and esteem it is because both peoples kept to this simple rule new comers set our traditions aside and in an instant what you see happens the work of years is undone and the good name of my district ruined for a generation i i can t see the end of this day s work mr fielding you who are imbued with modern ideas no doubt you can i wish i had never lived to see its beginning i know that it is the end of me that a lady that a young lady engaged to my most valued subordinate that she an english girl fresh from england that i should have lived i came down particularly on your account while poor heaslop got his mother away i regarded it as the most friendly thing i could do i meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at the club this evening to discuss the situation but i am doubtful whether you will care to come your visits there are always infrequent
p01397_A,01397,A,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p01398_A,01398,A,certainly
p01399_A,01399,A,you have a right to hold that opinion if you choose but pray is that any reason why you should insult mr heaslop
p01400_A,01400,A,certainly
p01401_A,01401,A,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p01402_A,01402,A,may i ask whether you have taken over charge of this district one moment mr fielding you are not to go yet please before you leave the club from which you do very well to resign you will express some detestation of the crime and you will apologize to mr heaslop
p01403_A,01403,A,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p01404_A,01404,A,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p01405_A,01405,A,oh no oh no no
p01406_A,01406,A,oh no no but not aziz not aziz absolutely impossible grotesque
p01407_A,01407,A,oh no who lodges this infamous charge
p01408_A,01408,A,then she s mad
p01409_A,01409,A,i m excessively sorry sir i certainly withdraw it unconditionally
p01410_A,01410,A,the news gave me a very great shock so i must ask you to forgive me i cannot believe that dr aziz is guilty
p01411_A,01411,A,if i may venture to say so no i make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies but the charge they are bringing against aziz rests upon some mistake and five minutes will clear it up the man s manner is perfectly natural besides i know him to be incapable of infamy
p01412_A,01412,A,i shall certainly come sir and i am most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken over me may i venture to ask where miss quested is
p01413_A,01413,A,may i make a statement sir
p01414_A,01414,A,i believe dr aziz to be innocent
p01415_A,01415,A,may i conclude my statement
p01416_A,01416,A,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p01417_A,01417,A,are you speaking to me officially sir
p01418_A,01418,A,i have accepted re election sir do you regard it as necessary i should come i should be glad to be excused indeed i have a dinner engagement this evening
p01419_A,01419,A,what is the charge precisely
p01420_A,01420,A,oh no oh no no it ll be cleared up in five minutes
p01421_A,01421,A,did she say any more
p01422_A,01422,A,i saw one of them there was an echo did it get on her nerves
p01423_A,01423,A,was a guide not with her
p01424_A,01424,A,i suppose there s no possibility of my seeing miss quested
p01425_A,01425,A,i was afraid you ld say that i should very much like to
p01426_A,01426,A,hardly at all but you see i believe she s under some hideous delusion and that that wretched boy is innocent
p01427_A,01427,A,those field glasses upset me for a minute but i ve thought since it s impossible that having attempted to assault her he would put her glasses into his pocket
p01428_A,01428,A,i don t follow
p01429_A,01429,A,i don t want to hear his private letters
p01430_A,01430,A,oh that ll do that ll do i dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for doing that but i haven t i did the same at his age miss quested really cannot be seen you do know that for a certainty
p01431_A,01431,A,on the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report and he s committed for trial and the whole thing goes to blazes old man don t argue about this but do of your goodness just ring up your wife or miss derek and enquire it ll cost you nothing
p01432_A,01432,A,he s sure to refuse it s all he exists for i only wanted to ask her whether she is certain dead certain that it was aziz who followed her into the cave
p01433_A,01433,A,but i wanted to ask her i want someone who believes in him to ask her
p01434_A,01434,A,she is among people who disbelieve in indians
p01435_A,01435,A,i know but she tells it to you
p01436_A,01436,A,i wish you wouldn t
p01437_A,01437,A,i feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous we are heading for a most awful smash i can see your prisoner i suppose
p01438_A,01438,A,well when he s done with them
p01439_A,01439,A,i say he s innocent
p01440_A,01440,A,oh good good one s got to breathe occasionally at least i have i mayn t see her and now i mayn t see him i promised him to come up here with him to you but turton called me off before i could get two steps
p01441_A,01441,A,so i have just told you
p01442_A,01442,A,i see what you mean
p01443_A,01443,A,can i visit aziz
p01444_A,01444,A,to whom do i apply for an order
p01445_A,01445,A,that sounds comfortable
p01446_A,01446,A,that s his wife
p01447_A,01447,A,he told me
p01448_A,01448,A,that he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances she hit at him with her field glasses he pulled at them and the strap broke and that is how she got away when we searched him just now they were in his pocket
p01449_A,01449,A,have a look at them
p01450_A,01450,A,there was an echo that appears to have frightened her did you go into those caves
p01451_A,01451,A,i couldn t worry her overmuch with questions she ll have plenty to go through in the witness box they don t bear thinking about these next weeks i wish the marabar hills and all they contain were at the bottom of the sea evening after evening one saw them from the club and they were just a harmless name yes we start already i heard some more from miss derek she is an old friend of us both and talks freely well her account is that you went off to locate the camp and almost at once she heard stones falling on the kawa dol and saw miss quested running straight down the face of a precipice well she climbed up a sort of gully to her and found her practically done for her helmet off
p01452_A,01452,A,no she had got among some cactuses miss derek saved her life coming just then she was beginning to fling herself about she helped her down to the car miss quested couldn t stand the indian driver cried and it was that that put our friend on the track of what had happened they made straight for our bungalow and are there now that s the story as far as i know it yet she sent the driver to join you i think she behaved with great sense
p01453_A,01453,A,i hardly think that would do surely
p01454_A,01454,A,she is in no state to see anyone besides you don t know her well
p01455_A,01455,A,i had no idea that was in your mind
p01456_A,01456,A,quite possible i m afraid when an indian goes bad he goes not only very bad but very queer
p01457_A,01457,A,how should you when you think of crime you think of english crime the psychology here is different i dare say you ll tell me next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to greet you no reason he should not be read any of the mutiny records which rather than the bhagavad gita should be your bible in this country though i m not sure that the one and the other are not closely connected am i not being beastly but you see fielding as i ve said to you once before you re a schoolmaster and consequently you come across these people at their best that s what puts you wrong they can be charming as boys but i know them as they really are after they have developed into men look at this for instance i am going through the contents they are not edifying here is a letter from a friend who apparently keeps a brothel
p01458_A,01458,A,it ll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals he was fixing up to see women at calcutta
p01459_A,01459,A,you have never explained to me what s in your mind here why on earth do you want to see her
p01460_A,01460,A,it s no use ringing up them callendar settles a question like that of course you haven t grasped that she s seriously ill
p01461_A,01461,A,possibly my wife might ask her that much
p01462_A,01462,A,what difference does that make
p01463_A,01463,A,well she tells her own story doesn t she
p01464_A,01464,A,a bit too finespun anyhow callendar won t hear of you seeing her i m sorry to say he gave a bad account just now he says that she is by no means out of danger i must put this report through now fielding
p01465_A,01465,A,how can i not
p01466_A,01466,A,his own people seem in touch with him all right
p01467_A,01467,A,i wouldn t keep you waiting good heavens you take precedence of any indian visitor of course i meant what s the good why mix yourself up with pitch
p01468_A,01468,A,innocence or guilt why mix yourself up what s the good
p01469_A,01469,A,sort of all white thing the burra sahib would do we shall all have to hang together old man i m afraid i m your junior in years i know but very much your senior in service you don t happen to know this poisonous country as well as i do and you must take it from me that the general situation is going to be nasty at chandrapore during the next few weeks very nasty indeed
p01470_A,01470,A,but at a time like this there s no room for well personal views the man who doesn t toe the line is lost
p01471_A,01471,A,no you don t see entirely he not only loses himself he weakens his friends if you leave the line you leave a gap in the line these jackals are looking with all their eyes for a gap
p01472_A,01472,A,no you may see him on a magistrate s order but on my own responsibility i don t feel justified it might lead to more complications
p01473_A,01473,A,city magistrate
p01474_A,01474,A,yes one can t very well worry poor heaslop photographs of women ah
p01475_A,01475,A,how do you know that
p01476_A,01476,A,well you must trot off now old man and the lord help us the lord help us all
p01477_A,01477,A,she is my own darling girl
p01478_A,01478,A,don t worry mrs blakiston those drums are only mohurram
p01479_A,01479,A,quite so not till monday
p01480_A,01480,A,mr mcbryde s down there disguised as a holy man
p01481_A,01481,A,i well i
p01482_A,01482,A,that s exactly the sort of thing that must not be said mrs callendar be more careful than that please in these times
p01483_A,01483,A,any more questions necessary questions
p01484_A,01484,A,is the where is he
p01485_A,01485,A,but it s the women and children they ought to be compelled to give hostages
p01486_A,01486,A,mrs blakiston was saying if only there were a few tommies
p01487_A,01487,A,right you are burra sahib angels exactly
p01488_A,01488,A,english no good native troops for this country give me the sporting type of native give me gurkhas give me rajputs give me jats give me the punjabi give me sikhs give me marathas bhils afridis and pathans and really if it comes to that i don t mind if you give me the scums of the bazaars properly led mind i d lead them anywhere
p01489_A,01489,A,some have never got up
p01490_A,01490,A,stand up you swine
p01491_A,01491,A,no one s out of danger in this country as long as they have a temperature
p01492_A,01492,A,take me some time to do that
p01493_A,01493,A,temperature
p01494_A,01494,A,so she may be i guarantee nothing i really can t be plagued with questions lesley
p01495_A,01495,A,heaslop also found out something from his mother aziz paid a herd of natives to suffocate her in a cave that was the end of her or would have been only she got out nicely planned wasn t it neat then he could go on with the girl he and she and a guide provided by the same mohammed latif guide now can t be found pretty it s not the time for sitting down it s the time for action call in the troops and clear the bazaars i suppose nothing that s said inside the club will go outside the club
p01496_A,01496,A,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p01497_A,01497,A,squat down callendar tell us all about it
p01498_A,01498,A,how s the old lady
p01499_A,01499,A,my wife heard she was sinking
p01500_A,01500,A,sorry old man
p01501_A,01501,A,why should it
p01502_A,01502,A,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p01503_A,01503,A,i wish to god i hadn t given my jewel of an assistant leave i ld cut my tongue out first to feel i m responsible that s what hits me to refuse and then give in under pressure that is what i did my sons that is what i did i understood an englishman was to accompany the expedition that is why i gave in
p01504_A,01504,A,i don t feel that i wish i could responsibility is a very awful thing and i ve no use for the man who shirks it heard about miss quested s servant
p01505_A,01505,A,we shall do we shall do
p01506_A,01506,A,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p01507_A,01507,A,no what about him
p01508_A,01508,A,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p01509_A,01509,A,do come quietly mary
p01510_A,01510,A,heaslop warned miss quested s servant last night never to lose sight of her prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him behind bribed him heaslop has just found out the whole story with names and sums a well known pimp to those people gave the money mohammed latif by name so much for the servant what about the englishman our friend here how did they get rid of him money again oh i m being misunderstood apologies i didn t mean they bribed mr fielding
p01511_A,01511,A,they paid the other indian to make you late godbole he was saying his prayers i know those prayers
p01512_A,01512,A,then what do you mean
p01513_A,01513,A,that s ridiculous
p01514_A,01514,A,does anyone here present want to
p01515_A,01515,A,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p01516_A,01516,A,you are sure to know best i have no experience burra sahib
p01517_A,01517,A,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p01518_A,01518,A,how is your mother old boy
p01519_A,01519,A,unexpected
p01520_A,01520,A,better thank you i wish everyone would sit down
p01521_A,01521,A,i do i do i m satisfied
p01522_A,01522,A,not one of them s all right
p01523_A,01523,A,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p01524_A,01524,A,my old das is all right
p01525_A,01525,A,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p01526_A,01526,A,hear hear
p01527_A,01527,A,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p01528_A,01528,A,he s a crank a crank
p01529_A,01529,A,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p01530_A,01530,A,that s that s the way to face it you have the pluck miss quested the fruits of democracy
p01531_A,01531,A,it s not ridiculous we think you wonderful it only bothers us that we can t help you more your stopping here at such a time is the greatest honour this house by the way a letter came here for you while you were ill i opened it which is a strange confession to make will you forgive me the circumstances are peculiar it is from fielding
p01532_A,01532,A,that s your way of putting it but a man can be a crank without being a cad miss quested had better know how he behaved to you if you don t tell her somebody else will he is now the mainstay of the defence i needn t add he is the one righteous englishman in a horde of tyrants he receives deputations from the bazaar and they all chew betel nut and smear one another s hands with scent it is not easy to enter into the mind of such a man his students are on strike out of enthusiasm for him they won t learn their lessons if it weren t for fielding one would never have had the mohurram trouble he has done a very grave disservice to the whole community the letter lay here a day or two waiting till you were well enough then the situation got so grave that i decided to open it in case it was useful to us
p01533_A,01533,A,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p01534_A,01534,A,the prisoner and the guide took you on to the kawa dol no one else being present
p01535_A,01535,A,very well there is a ledge half way up the hill or broken ground rather with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah
p01536_A,01536,A,you went alone into one of those caves
p01537_A,01537,A,the prisoner followed you didn t he
p01538_A,01538,A,certainly
p01539_A,01539,A,i beg your pardon
p01540_A,01540,A,i didn t catch that answer you are on that landing or whatever we term it and you have entered a cave i suggest to you that the prisoner followed you what do you mean please
p01541_A,01541,A,what is that what are you saying speak up please
p01542_A,01542,A,what nature of mistake
p01543_A,01543,A,i must come before someone
p01544_A,01544,A,i do this less every day i shall soon be quite well what i need is something to do that is why i keep on with this ridiculous crying
p01545_A,01545,A,why should he write to me
p01546_A,01546,A,is it
p01547_A,01547,A,the most wonderfully shaped of those hills yes no one else was present to my knowledge we appeared to be alone
p01548_A,01548,A,i know where you mean
p01549_A,01549,A,that is quite correct
p01550_A,01550,A,may i have half a minute before i reply to that mr mcbryde
p01551_A,01551,A,i am not i am not quite sure
p01552_A,01552,A,i cannot be sure
p01553_A,01553,A,no
p01554_A,01554,A,i m afraid i have made a mistake
p01555_A,01555,A,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p01556_A,01556,A,a most lamentable thing has happened the defence got hold of him
p01557_A,01557,A,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p01558_A,01558,A,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p01559_A,01559,A,all right i said don t apologize
p01560_A,01560,A,swine i should think so and what s more i ll tell you what what s happened is a damn good thing really barring of course its application to present company it ll make them squeal and it s time they did squeal i ve put the fear of god into them at the hospital anyhow you should see the grandson of our so called leading loyalist his beauty s gone five upper teeth two lower and a nostril old panna lal brought him the looking glass yesterday and he blubbered i laughed i laughed i tell you and so would you that used to be one of these buck niggers i thought now he s all septic damn him blast his soul er i believe he was unspeakably immoral er i wish i d had the cutting up of my late assistant too nothing s too bad for these people
p01561_A,01561,A,that s what i say i say there s not such a thing as cruelty after a thing like this
p01562_A,01562,A,at last some sense is being talked
p01563_A,01563,A,that s better
p01564_A,01564,A,even when the lady is so uglier than the gentleman
p01565_A,01565,A,turn that man out
p01566_A,01566,A,i must have better arrangements than this made for my patient why isn t she given a seat on the platform she gets no air
p01567_A,01567,A,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p01568_A,01568,A,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p01569_A,01569,A,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p01570_A,01570,A,thoroughly desirable change for several reasons right mcbryde go ahead now sorry to have interrupted you
p01571_A,01571,A,are you all right yourselves
p01572_A,01572,A,and the prisoner followed you
p01573_A,01573,A,excuse me we object to the presence of so many european ladies and gentlemen upon the platform they will have the effect of intimidating our witnesses their place is with the rest of the public in the body of the hall we have no objection to miss quested remaining on the platform since she has been unwell we shall extend every courtesy to her throughout despite the scientific truths revealed to us by the district superintendent of police but we do object to the others
p01574_A,01574,A,i agree to that it was only to miss quested that i gave permission to sit up here her friends should be so excessively kind as to climb down
p01575_A,01575,A,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p01576_A,01576,A,mr mahmoud ali will have to apologize in person
p01577_A,01577,A,i should object a platform confers authority
p01578_A,01578,A,thank you very much sir thank you mr heaslop thank you ladies all
p01579_A,01579,A,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p01580_A,01580,A,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p01581_A,01581,A,enough sit down mr mcbryde do you wish to continue in the face of this
p01582_A,01582,A,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p01583_A,01583,A,not buddhist i think jain
p01584_A,01584,A,all the marabar caves are jain
p01585_A,01585,A,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p01586_A,01586,A,in which cave is the offence alleged the buddhist or the jain
p01587_A,01587,A,yes sir then in which jain cave
p01588_A,01588,A,you don t because you can t you have smuggled her out of the country she is mrs moore she would have proved his innocence she was on our side she was poor indians friend
p01589_A,01589,A,imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth i ruin my career no matter we are all to be ruined one by one
p01590_A,01590,A,i am not defending a case nor are you trying one we are both of us slaves
p01591_A,01591,A,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p01592_A,01592,A,this is no way to defend your case
p01593_A,01593,A,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p01594_A,01594,A,she was kept from us until too late i learn too late this is english justice here is your british raj give us back mrs moore for five minutes only and she will save my friend she will save the name of his sons don t rule her out mr das take back those words as you yourself are a father tell me where they have put her oh mrs moore
p01595_A,01595,A,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p01596_A,01596,A,do so this trial is a farce i am going aziz aziz farewell for ever
p01597_A,01597,A,esmiss esmoor esmiss esmoor esmiss esmoor esmiss esmoor
p01598_A,01598,A,i apologize for my colleague he is an intimate friend of our client and his feelings have carried him away
p01599_A,01599,A,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p01600_A,01600,A,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p01601_A,01601,A,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p01602_A,01602,A,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p01603_A,01603,A,are you mad
p01604_A,01604,A,right i withdraw
p01605_A,01605,A,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p01606_A,01606,A,you withdraw the charge answer me
p01607_A,01607,A,dr aziz never
p01608_A,01608,A,i withdraw everything
p01609_A,01609,A,give me time to consider
p01610_A,01610,A,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p01611_A,01611,A,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p01612_A,01612,A,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p01613_A,01613,A,sir i intend these for you sir
p01614_A,01614,A,i don t want the rubbish get out
p01615_A,01615,A,fetch my sais rafi there s a good chap
p01616_A,01616,A,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p01617_A,01617,A,oh my god
p01618_A,01618,A,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say
p01619_A,01619,A,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours
p01620_A,01620,A,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p01621_A,01621,A,he comes he comes he comes i cringe i tremble
p01622_A,01622,A,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p01623_A,01623,A,ah you were boasting she had reached aden in court
p01624_A,01624,A,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p01625_A,01625,A,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p01626_A,01626,A,quite so i have given trouble enough
p01627_A,01627,A,do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now
p01628_A,01628,A,at last
p01629_A,01629,A,will you ask him what he wants mr fielding
p01630_A,01630,A,does he tell me to come out to him
p01631_A,01631,A,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p01632_A,01632,A,we hear sir that your mother has died may we ask where the cable came from
p01633_A,01633,A,aden

p01686_A,01686,A,certainly not it returns to my dispensary at once now do you want me to treat your stings or do you prefer an english doctor there is one at asirgarh asirgarh is forty miles away and the ringnod dam broken now you see how you are placed i think i had better see mr fielding about you this is really great nonsense your present behaviour
p01687_A,01687,A,they have not gone in the direction of mau i hope on a night like this the people become most fanatical
p01688_A,01688,A,like what
p01689_A,01689,A,i must go back now good night don t you think me unkind any more
p01690_A,01690,A,how can you tell you strange fellow
p01691_A,01691,A,can you always tell whether a stranger is your friend
p01692_A,01692,A,then you are an oriental take this think of me when you use it i shall never want it back i must give you one little present and it is all i have got you are mrs moore s son
p01693_A,01693,A,but you are heaslop s brother also and alas the two nations cannot be friends
p01694_A,01694,A,did your mother speak to you about me
p01695_A,01695,A,yes your mother was my best friend in all the world this is our monsoon the best weather how i wish she could have seen them our rains now is the time when all things are happy young and old they are happy out there with their savage noise though we cannot follow them the tanks are all full so they dance and this is india i wish you were not with officials then i would show you my country but i cannot perhaps i will just take you out on the water now for one short half hour
p01696_A,01696,A,what what do you mean
p01697_A,01697,A,but there s no rajah nothing
p01698_A,01698,A,i can t tell you what that is i m sure his highness is dead i think we should go back at once shall we go back now
p01699_A,01699,A,i d rather not go nearer they have such strange customs and might hurt you
p01700_A,01700,A,mr moore don t tell anyone that the rajah is dead it is a secret still i am supposed not to say we pretend he is alive until after the festival to prevent unhappiness do you want to go still nearer
p00000_B,00000,B,but you understand my meaning
p00001_B,00001,B,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do
p00002_B,00002,B,some case i daresay
p00003_B,00003,B,on the one hand he always does this on the other it may be a serious case and you cannot know had you not better clean your teeth after pan
p00004_B,00004,B,i was going to suggest we go behind the purdah but your three treacherous children are there so you will not want to
p00005_B,00005,B,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p00006_B,00006,B,if you had been sensible and made miss quested pay
p00007_B,00007,B,to such a remark there is certainly no reply have you heard this naughty rumour that mohammed latif has got hold of
p00008_B,00008,B,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00009_B,00009,B,no let us surprise them without warning far too much nonsense still goes on among our ladies they pretended at the time of your trial they would give up purdah indeed those of them who can write composed a document to that effect and now it ends in humbug you know how deeply they all respect fielding but not one of them has seen him my wife says she will but always when he calls there is some excuse she is not feeling well she is ashamed of the room she has no nice sweets to offer him only elephants ears and if i say elephants ears are mr fielding s favourite sweet she replies that he will know how badly hers are made so she cannot see him on their account for fifteen years my dear boy have i argued with my begum for fifteen years and never gained a point yet the missionaries inform us our women are down trodden if you want a subject for a poem take this the indian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be
p00010_B,00010,B,yes he has done his duty do not tease him so he carries on his family two boys and their sister
p00011_B,00011,B,no no i do not admit that i have met others
p00012_B,00012,B,oh that is going much too far
p00013_B,00013,B,where to turtons and burtons all are the same
p00014_B,00014,B,when miss quested stopped in the college fielding used to visit her rather too late in the evening the servants say
p00015_B,00015,B,aziz aziz imprudent boy
p00016_B,00016,B,i believe the politicals are obliged to have better manners it amounts to no more
p00017_B,00017,B,do not apologize you are always late
p00018_B,00018,B,aziz don t chatter we are having a very sad talk
p00019_B,00019,B,and mine
p00020_B,00020,B,very well but your life must continue a poor man s no holidays in kashmir for you yet you must stick to your profession and rise to a highly paid post not retire to a jungle state and write poems educate your children read the latest scientific periodicals compel european doctors to respect you accept the consequences of your own actions like a man
p00021_B,00021,B,but the money the money they will never pay an adequate salary those savage rajahs
p00022_B,00022,B,you mustn t put off what you think right that is why india is in such a plight because we put off things
p00023_B,00023,B,nureddin s mother is visiting my wife now that is all right i think
p00024_B,00024,B,you are a very selfish boy but take my case the case of young hugh bannister here is the son of my dear my dead friends the reverend and mrs bannister whose goodness to me in england i shall never forget or describe they were father and mother to me i talked to them as i do now in the vacations their rectory became my home they entrusted all their children to me i often carried little hugh about i took him up to the funeral of queen victoria and held him in my arms above the crowd
p00025_B,00025,B,it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand
p00026_B,00026,B,aunt they live most comfortably with my wife s mother where she was living when she died i can see them whenever i like they are such very very small children
p00027_B,00027,B,just still your meaning doesn t help me out of my difficulties i am determined to leave chandrapore the problem is for where i am determined to write poetry the problem is about what you give me no assistance but who does give me assistance no one is my friend all are traitors even my own children i have had enough of friends
p00028_B,00028,B,i am sorry it is ever since i was in prison my temper is strange take me forgive me
p00029_B,00029,B,which
p00030_B,00030,B,i shall never be rich anywhere it is outside my character
p00031_B,00031,B,if my teeth are to be cleaned i don t go at all i am an indian it is an indian habit to take pan the civil surgeon must put up with it mohammed latif my bike please
p00032_B,00032,B,i daresay not i daresay nothing he has found out our dinner hour that s all and chooses to interrupt us every time in order to show his power
p00033_B,00033,B,i cannot endure committees i shall go right away
p00034_B,00034,B,once is enough
p00035_B,00035,B,why talk about the english brrrr why be either friends with the fellows or not friends let us shut them out and be jolly queen victoria and mrs bannister were the only exceptions and they re dead
p00036_B,00036,B,that pure minded fellow however he will blame the indian climate everything is our fault really now have i not discovered an important piece of news for you cyril
p00037_B,00037,B,but not in an indian state
p00038_B,00038,B,i chose not to discussion of the past is useless i have allowed her to keep her fortune and buy herself a husband in england for which it will be very necessary don t mention the matter again
p00039_B,00039,B,but the sahib has left me some message
p00040_B,00040,B,it is not going as far as mr ram chand
p00041_B,00041,B,a pleasant change for her if he did
p00042_B,00042,B,kindly answer my question am i late has mahmoud ali eaten all the food if so i go elsewhere mr mahmoud ali how are you
p00043_B,00043,B,does there happen to be such a thing as a hookah in that happier world of yours
p00044_B,00044,B,i do not believe him
p00045_B,00045,B,we are not in the law courts there are many ways of being a man mine is to express what is deepest in my heart
p00046_B,00046,B,old callendar wants to see me at his bungalow he might have the politeness to say why
p00047_B,00047,B,they come before me separately but not so far together you had better prepare them for the united shock of my face
p00048_B,00048,B,oh not yet hookah is so jolly now
p00049_B,00049,B,i do want to get away from british india even to a poor job i think i could write poetry there i wish i had lived in babur s time and fought and written for him gone gone and not even any use to say for it weakens us while we say it we need a king hamidullah it would make our lives easier as it is we must try to appreciate these quaint hindus my notion now is to try for some post as doctor in one of their states
p00050_B,00050,B,hamidullah here is actually dead he passed away just as you rode up on your bike
p00051_B,00051,B,they are torturing him
p00052_B,00052,B,they put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds
p00053_B,00053,B,thank you dr aziz i am dying
p00054_B,00054,B,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00055_B,00055,B,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00056_B,00056,B,dying before your dinner oh poor mahmoud ali
p00057_B,00057,B,nureddin
p00058_B,00058,B,oh my god
p00059_B,00059,B,i learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at cawnpore imagine how i long to see him and to pay his fare that this house may be his home but it is useless the other anglo indians will have got hold of him long ago he will probably think that i want something and i cannot face that from the son of my old friends oh what in this country has gone wrong with everything vakil sahib i ask you
p00060_B,00060,B,yes that is so imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world
p00061_B,00061,B,and does it
p00062_B,00062,B,we all admire them aziz please pass me the hookah
p00063_B,00063,B,i do not think so they all become exactly the same not worse not better i give any englishman two years be he turton or burton it is only the difference of a letter and i give any englishwoman six months all are exactly alike do you not agree with me
p00064_B,00064,B,i only contend that it is possible in england
p00065_B,00065,B,come and see my wife a little then
p00066_B,00066,B,bribes
p00067_B,00067,B,yes they have no chance here that is my point they come out intending to be gentlemen and are told it will not do look at lesley look at blakiston now it is your red nosed boy and fielding will go next why i remember when turton came out first it was in another part of the province you fellows will not believe me but i have driven with turton in his carriage turton oh yes we were once quite intimate he has shown me his stamp collection
p00068_B,00068,B,so have i all ladies are far from alike
p00069_B,00069,B,well look at my own experience this morning
p00070_B,00070,B,no that is where mrs turton is so skilful when we poor blacks take bribes we perform what we are bribed to perform and the law discovers us in consequence the english take and do nothing i admire them
p00071_B,00071,B,queen victoria was different
p00072_B,00072,B,i do not for my own part i find such profound differences among our rulers red nose mumbles turton talks distinctly mrs turton takes bribes mrs red nose does not and cannot because so far there is no mrs red nose
p00073_B,00073,B,it is impossible here aziz the red nosed boy has again insulted me in court i do not blame him he was told that he ought to insult me until lately he was quite a nice boy but the others have got hold of him
p00074_B,00074,B,down with the civil surgeon rescue nureddin
p00075_B,00075,B,did you not know that when they were lent to central india over a canal scheme some rajah or other gave her a sewing machine in solid gold so that the water should run through his state
p00076_B,00076,B,he would expect you to steal it now turton but red nosed boy will be far worse than turton
p00077_B,00077,B,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00078_B,00078,B,what is to become of all our daughters if men refuse to marry they will marry beneath them or
p00079_B,00079,B,perhaps but later
p00080_B,00080,B,huzoor all are at the club

p00135_B,00135,B,mrs mrs moore i am afraid i startled you i shall tell my community our friends about you that god is here very good very fine indeed i think you are newly arrived in india
p00136_B,00136,B,you remember the water by our mosque it comes down and fills this tank a skilful arrangement of the emperors they stopped here going down into bengal they loved water wherever they went they created fountains gardens hammams i was telling mr fielding i would give anything to serve them
p00137_B,00137,B,mine would god would give me more when he saw i gave always be giving like the nawab bahadur my father was the same that is why he died poor so we would sit giving for ever on a carpet instead of chairs that is the chief change between now and then but i think we would never punish anyone poor criminal give him another chance it only makes a man worse to go to prison and be corrupted we punish no one no one and in the evening we will give a great banquet with a nautch and lovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks in their hands and all shall be feasting and happiness until the next day when there shall be justice as before fifty rupees a hundred a thousand till peace comes ah why didn t we live in that time but are you admiring mr fielding s house do look how the pillars are painted blue and the verandah s pavilions what do you call them that are above us inside are blue also look at the carving on the pavilions think of the hours it took their little roofs are curved to imitate bamboo so pretty and the bamboos waving by the tank outside mrs moore mrs moore

p00149_B,00149,B,madam this is a mosque you have no right here at all you should have taken off your shoes this is a holy place for moslems
p00150_B,00150,B,you have
p00151_B,00151,B,i suppose the civil surgeon took you
p00152_B,00152,B,she has just taken my tonga without my permission do you call that being charming and major callendar interrupts me night after night from where i am dining with my friends and i go at once breaking up a most pleasant entertainment and he is not there and not even a message is this charming pray but what does it matter i can do nothing and he knows it i am just a subordinate my time is of no value the verandah is good enough for an indian yes yes let him stand and mrs callendar takes my carriage and cuts me dead you understand me you know what others feel oh if others resembled you
p00153_B,00153,B,that is even more impossible but may i know the facts
p00154_B,00154,B,i think you ought not to walk at night alone mrs moore there are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the marabar hills snakes also for example a six spot beetle you pick it up it bites you die
p00155_B,00155,B,mrs moore this is all extremely strange because like yourself i have also two sons and a daughter is not this the same box with a vengeance
p00156_B,00156,B,then we are in the same box then is the city magistrate the entire of your family now
p00157_B,00157,B,friendships last longest that begin like that i think shall i ever entertain your other children
p00158_B,00158,B,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00159_B,00159,B,then i ask your pardon i am truly sorry for speaking
p00160_B,00160,B,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00161_B,00161,B,i feared at mr fielding s that it might be settled the other way black knave on a red queen
p00162_B,00162,B,ah very likely
p00163_B,00163,B,call what a ghost
p00164_B,00164,B,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p00165_B,00165,B,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00166_B,00166,B,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00167_B,00167,B,say say say as if anything can be said i have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings i have listened too much it is time i was left in peace not to die no doubt you expect me to die but when i have seen you and ronny married and seen the other two and whether they want to be married i ll retire then into a cave of my own somewhere where no young people will come asking questions and expecting answers some shelf
p00168_B,00168,B,i couldn t have been thinking of what i was saying
p00169_B,00169,B,it is the children who are the first consideration until they are grown up and married off when that happens one has again the right to live for oneself in the plains or the hills as suits
p00170_B,00170,B,i am not good no bad a bad old woman bad bad detestable i used to be good with the children growing up also i meet this young man in his mosque i wanted him to be happy good happy small people they do not exist they were a dream but i will not help you to torture him for what he never did there are different ways of evil and i prefer mine to yours
p00171_B,00171,B,i was going to tell you adela but something changed the conversation and i forgot my memory grows deplorable
p00172_B,00172,B,that s much the best feeling to have
p00173_B,00173,B,if you don t know you don t know i can t tell you
p00174_B,00174,B,don t you know
p00175_B,00175,B,i believe in the hot weather but never did i suppose it would bottle me up as it will
p00176_B,00176,B,only various shades of the dark
p00177_B,00177,B,very nice
p00178_B,00178,B,ah dearest grasmere
p00179_B,00179,B,i don t think i shall go on to there i dislike climbing
p00180_B,00180,B,is it again my duty to talk apparently as you keep interrupting me
p00181_B,00181,B,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00182_B,00182,B,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00183_B,00183,B,i wouldn t worry it s partly the odd surroundings you and i keep on attending to trifles instead of what s important we are what the people here call new
p00184_B,00184,B,very well you get another servant and i ll keep antony with me i am used to his unappetizing ways he will see me through the hot weather
p00185_B,00185,B,of course he is innocent
p00186_B,00186,B,i want to see it too and i only wish we could apparently the turtons will arrange something for next tuesday
p00187_B,00187,B,i went to the mosque but i did not catch the moon
p00188_B,00188,B,a horrid stuffy place really
p00189_B,00189,B,ah but that ll disappoint him so he has taken such trouble you should go on you don t mind
p00190_B,00190,B,oh what of the echo
p00191_B,00191,B,india s
p00192_B,00192,B,if one has not become too stupid and old
p00193_B,00193,B,she has children you see
p00194_B,00194,B,i don t suppose you ever will
p00195_B,00195,B,later and later let me think we don t see the other side of the moon out here no
p00196_B,00196,B,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00197_B,00197,B,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00198_B,00198,B,the animal thing that hit us didn t you say oh a ghost in passing
p00199_B,00199,B,you mean that my bothers are mixed up with india
p00200_B,00200,B,yes that is so
p00201_B,00201,B,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00202_B,00202,B,ah that s true well by marrying mr heaslop i shall become what is known as an anglo indian
p00203_B,00203,B,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00204_B,00204,B,what made you call it a ghost
p00205_B,00205,B,i won t be bottled up i ve no patience with these women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains mrs mcbryde hasn t stopped down once since she married she leaves her quite intelligent husband alone half the year and then s surprised she s out of touch with him
p00206_B,00206,B,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00207_B,00207,B,was he nice
p00208_B,00208,B,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00209_B,00209,B,no what is it oh do say i felt you would be able to explain it this will comfort me so
p00210_B,00210,B,mrs moore what is this echo
p00211_B,00211,B,i want to sack antony his behaviour on the platform has decided me anyhow we must get a second servant because at simla you will be at the hotel and i don t think ronny s baldeo
p00212_B,00212,B,oh yes you re perfectly right i never thought it out
p00213_B,00213,B,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00214_B,00214,B,my idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in simla at all events to see me through the wedding after which ronny means to reorganize his staff entirely he does it very well for a bachelor still when he is married no doubt various changes will have to be made his old servants won t want to take their orders from me and i don t blame them anything to be seen of the hills
p00215_B,00215,B,but he says this isn t a good cave the best are on the kawa dol
p00216_B,00216,B,you see ronny i was right
p00217_B,00217,B,it was probably a hyena as a matter of fact
p00218_B,00218,B,perhaps i ought to
p00219_B,00219,B,i suppose so
p00220_B,00220,B,get in dr aziz you make us giddy if they re so foolish as to miss the train that s their loss not ours
p00221_B,00221,B,i thought you said but it was in mr fielding s letter
p00222_B,00222,B,it ll end in an elephant ride it always does look at this evening cousin kate imagine cousin kate but where have you been off to did you succeed in catching the moon in the ganges
p00223_B,00223,B,the angle would have altered she rises later
p00224_B,00224,B,we can t be far from the place where my hyena was perhaps this is mine anyhow the road runs parallel with the railway i will fetch you from simla when it s cool enough i will unbottle you in fact we then see some of the mogul stuff how appalling if we let you miss the taj and then i will see you off at bombay your last glimpse of this country really shall be interesting they re rather wonderful i ld not have missed this for anything look the sun s rising this ll be absolutely magnificent come quickly look i wouldn t have missed this for anything we should never have seen it if we d stuck to the turtons and their eternal elephants ah that must be the false dawn isn t it caused by dust in the upper layers of the atmosphere that couldn t fall down during the night i think mr mcbryde said so well i must admit that england has it as regards sunrises do you remember grasmere
p00225_B,00225,B,very well let s sit down again in the shade until breakfast s ready
p00226_B,00226,B,yes i mean that at least not exactly but there is this echo that i keep on hearing
p00227_B,00227,B,you heard me tell aziz and godbole i wasn t stopping in their country i didn t mean it so why did i say it i feel i haven t been frank enough attentive enough or something it s as if i got everything out of proportion you have been so very good to me and i meant to be good when i sailed but somehow i haven t been mrs moore if one isn t absolutely honest what is the use of existing
p00228_B,00228,B,oh yes that s true
p00229_B,00229,B,i don t believe in the hot weather people like major callendar who always talk about it it s in the hope of making one feel inexperienced and small like their everlasting i ve been twenty years in this country
p00230_B,00230,B,i can t get rid of it
p00231_B,00231,B,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00232_B,00232,B,dr aziz what s happened to your hills the train has forgotten to stop
p00233_B,00233,B,we aren t even seeing the other side of the world that s our complaint
p00234_B,00234,B,try seeing indians
p00235_B,00235,B,he isn t a bounder his nerves are on edge that s all
p00236_B,00236,B,i don t know he was all right when i left
p00237_B,00237,B,i m afraid i can t thanks all the same i m awfully sorry you feel i ve been remiss i didn t mean to be
p00238_B,00238,B,fancy if i d fallen or got angry
p00239_B,00239,B,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p00240_B,00240,B,i really can t see the harm
p00241_B,00241,B,i m sorry what s up
p00242_B,00242,B,oh well come along now and take your ladies away the catastrophe over
p00243_B,00243,B,i shall go round at once
p00244_B,00244,B,she stopped as she smokes by her own wish old man
p00245_B,00245,B,my old das is all right
p00246_B,00246,B,our schoolmaster government college
p00247_B,00247,B,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p00248_B,00248,B,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00249_B,00249,B,but i want to see them
p00250_B,00250,B,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00251_B,00251,B,oh lucky you
p00252_B,00252,B,even from one s patients
p00253_B,00253,B,that occurs after so many meetings
p00254_B,00254,B,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00255_B,00255,B,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00256_B,00256,B,how if he went to heaven
p00257_B,00257,B,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00258_B,00258,B,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00259_B,00259,B,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00260_B,00260,B,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00261_B,00261,B,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00262_B,00262,B,i suppose he is guilty can i possibly have made a mistake
p00263_B,00263,B,drink it up not a bad notion a peg
p00264_B,00264,B,you won t
p00265_B,00265,B,you re bound to win
p00266_B,00266,B,well we don t come across them socially they re full of all the virtues but we don t and it s now eleven thirty and too late to go into the reasons
p00267_B,00267,B,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00268_B,00268,B,i had gathered as much those drums are merely mohurram of course
p00269_B,00269,B,miss quested what a name
p00270_B,00270,B,harry is there any news from the city
p00271_B,00271,B,i should think i did champagne too
p00272_B,00272,B,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00273_B,00273,B,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00274_B,00274,B,of course she won t she s a real sport
p00275_B,00275,B,they ought never to have been allowed to drive in it s so bad for them why they come at all i don t know they hate it as much as we do talk to mrs mcbryde her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck
p00276_B,00276,B,what do you want me to do oh those purdah women i never thought any would come oh dear i consider they ought to come over to me
p00277_B,00277,B,quite so not till monday
p00278_B,00278,B,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00279_B,00279,B,i refuse to shake hands with any of the men unless it has to be the nawab bahadur
p00280_B,00280,B,everything absolutely normal
p00281_B,00281,B,india does wonders for the judgment especially during the hot weather it has even done wonders for fielding
p00282_B,00282,B,she s saying her prayers
p00283_B,00283,B,merely the preparations for it the procession is not till next week
p00284_B,00284,B,i don t hate them i don t know why
p00285_B,00285,B,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00286_B,00286,B,come along mary get it over
p00287_B,00287,B,will all ladies leave the smoking room now please and remember what i have said we look to you to help us through a difficult time and you can help us by behaving as if everything is normal it is all i ask can i rely on you
p00288_B,00288,B,do come quietly mary
p00289_B,00289,B,whom have we so far h m h m much as one expected we know why he s here i think over that contract and he wants to get the right side of me for mohurram and he s the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations and he s that parsi and he s hullo there he goes smash into our hollyhocks pulled the left rein when he meant the right all as usual
p00290_B,00290,B,but she thinks it
p00291_B,00291,B,aziz aziz aziz have i made a mistake
p00292_B,00292,B,what animal
p00293_B,00293,B,oughtn t we to get back to the bungalow
p00294_B,00294,B,anyhow we ve not quarrelled ronny
p00295_B,00295,B,have you been to them
p00296_B,00296,B,oh no ronny it has red bars on its wings
p00297_B,00297,B,it s nothing to do with them that i
p00298_B,00298,B,but ronny i heard her
p00299_B,00299,B,isn t the lesson that you should invite all the pleaders to have a smoke with you
p00300_B,00300,B,good evening
p00301_B,00301,B,i thought you were discussing the caves
p00302_B,00302,B,ronny he s innocent i made an awful mistake
p00303_B,00303,B,the marabar caves
p00304_B,00304,B,oh naturally
p00305_B,00305,B,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00306_B,00306,B,my echo s better
p00307_B,00307,B,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00308_B,00308,B,i thought there was to be no polo
p00309_B,00309,B,have i really
p00310_B,00310,B,help me to do what i ought aziz is good you heard your mother say so
p00311_B,00311,B,not a bit
p00312_B,00312,B,i suppose i can t how amazing of me
p00313_B,00313,B,but let us discuss things it s all so frightfully important we mustn t make false steps i want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both
p00314_B,00314,B,we didn t skid we ran into an animal
p00315_B,00315,B,i know but
p00316_B,00316,B,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00317_B,00317,B,quite so
p00318_B,00318,B,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00319_B,00319,B,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00320_B,00320,B,so am i i m useless at everything
p00321_B,00321,B,the idea more than the words
p00322_B,00322,B,i know i don t and i want to what is the difference please
p00323_B,00323,B,i only want everything to be absolutely clear between us and to answer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct
p00324_B,00324,B,that s it that s it i knew i d heard his name somewhere i am so grateful to you for clearing this up it s the sort of mistake that worries me and proves i m neurotic
p00325_B,00325,B,it s something very different nothing to do with caves that i wanted to talk over with you i ve finally decided we are not going to be married my dear boy
p00326_B,00326,B,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00327_B,00327,B,i think perhaps i ought to see your mother and discuss future plans
p00328_B,00328,B,if dr aziz never did it he ought to be let out
p00329_B,00329,B,he s good i ve been so wrong to accuse him
p00330_B,00330,B,he did not if you had spoken to him we could have arranged them have i said anything funny
p00331_B,00331,B,dear old boy ronny she isn t ill too
p00332_B,00332,B,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00333_B,00333,B,good gracious no
p00334_B,00334,B,didn t she
p00335_B,00335,B,i think we shall keep friends
p00336_B,00336,B,i suppose that there is nothing else it s unpardonable of me to have given you and your mother all this bother yes nothing else we ve been awfully british over it but i suppose that s all right
p00337_B,00337,B,but ronny dear ronny perhaps there oughtn t to be any trial
p00338_B,00338,B,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00339_B,00339,B,i don t know the animals any better than the birds here too big for a goat
p00340_B,00340,B,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00341_B,00341,B,when her voice dropped she said it towards the end when she talked about love love i couldn t follow but just then she said doctor aziz never did it
p00342_B,00342,B,never never my dear girl complete illusion his name was not mentioned by anyone look here you are confusing this with fielding s letter
p00343_B,00343,B,that s good you ll be perfectly well in a few days but you must save yourself up for the trial das is a very good fellow we shall all be with you
p00344_B,00344,B,no but i know all about them naturally
p00345_B,00345,B,that s as you like but there s no hurry is there
p00346_B,00346,B,why
p00347_B,00347,B,parrot
p00348_B,00348,B,so you won t go saying he s innocent again will you for every servant i ve got is a spy they all hate us it ll be all right after the verdict for i will say this for them they do accept the accomplished fact but at present they re pouring out money like water to catch us tripping and a remark like yours is the very thing they look out for it would enable them to say it was a put up job on the part of us officials you see what i mean
p00349_B,00349,B,you were not right she never said it
p00350_B,00350,B,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00351_B,00351,B,i know we shall
p00352_B,00352,B,but i haven t got any questions you ve acted within your rights you were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my work it was an excellent plan and anyhow it s no use talking further we should only get up steam
p00353_B,00353,B,perhaps but time s limited and the flesh weak i prefer my smoke at the club amongst my own sort i m afraid
p00354_B,00354,B,i want you and mother at once there s to be polo
p00355_B,00355,B,so i am aziz was exquisitely dressed from tie pin to spats but he had forgotten his back collar stud and there you have the indian all over inattention to detail the fundamental slackness that reveals the race similarly to meet in the caves as if they were the clock at charing cross when they re miles from a station and each other
p00356_B,00356,B,pure illusion you can t be quite well can you to make up a thing like that
p00357_B,00357,B,well i m blessed did he descend to any details
p00358_B,00358,B,are you too pledged to this expedition mother
p00359_B,00359,B,well sit down anyhow
p00360_B,00360,B,i say adela what was it
p00361_B,00361,B,not allowed
p00362_B,00362,B,everything s altered some soldier men have come in come along and i ll tell you about it
p00363_B,00363,B,who cares what she thinks
p00364_B,00364,B,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00365_B,00365,B,heard what
p00366_B,00366,B,come along and let s tell the mater all this
p00367_B,00367,B,dear old girl to say so
p00368_B,00368,B,mcbryde has an illustrated bird book i m no good at all at birds in fact i m useless at any information outside my own job it s a great pity
p00369_B,00369,B,no but aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves he meant nothing by the invitation i could tell by his voice it s just their way of being pleasant
p00370_B,00370,B,our old gentleman is helpful and sound as he always is over public affairs you ve seen in him our show indian
p00371_B,00371,B,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00372_B,00372,B,out where
p00373_B,00373,B,oh that would have been too absurd why should we quarrel
p00374_B,00374,B,what was i warning you just now you know you re right and the whole station knows it
p00375_B,00375,B,it s different it s different you don t understand
p00376_B,00376,B,there s your ganges it s not much of a dead body that gets down to chandrapore
p00377_B,00377,B,you never said we should marry my dear girl you never bound either yourself or me don t let this upset you
p00378_B,00378,B,i don t quite know what you re saying and i don t think you do
p00379_B,00379,B,but you ll find her irritable we are an irritable family well you ll see for yourself no doubt my own nerves are out of order and i expected more from mother when i came in from the office than she felt able to give she is sure to make a special effort for you still i don t want your home coming to be a disappointing one don t expect too much
p00380_B,00380,B,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00381_B,00381,B,those words
p00382_B,00382,B,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00383_B,00383,B,i was listening to all she said as far as it could be listened to she gets very incoherent
p00384_B,00384,B,mother never said so
p00385_B,00385,B,i was only thinking how the worthy doctor s collar climbed up his neck
p00386_B,00386,B,i m afraid so incredible aren t they even the best of them they re all they all forget their back collar studs sooner or later you ve had to do with three sets of indians to day the bhattacharyas aziz and this chap and it really isn t a coincidence that they ve all let you down
p00387_B,00387,B,oh we had a small accident on the marabar road adela thinks it was a hyena
p00388_B,00388,B,do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is bee eater
p00389_B,00389,B,he was let out until the mohurram riot when he had to be put in again half a minute
p00390_B,00390,B,as we are british i suppose it is
p00391_B,00391,B,i don t much believe in this discussing besides i m so dead with all this extra work mohurram s bringing if you ll excuse me
p00392_B,00392,B,you re over tired
p00393_B,00393,B,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p00394_B,00394,B,by jove she s right the paint s gone
p00395_B,00395,B,he called to you in the mosque did he how impudently what was he doing there himself at that time of night no it s not their prayer time so he called to you over your shoes then it was impudence it s an old trick i wish you had had them on
p00396_B,00396,B,she never mentioned that name once
p00397_B,00397,B,my duties here are evidently finished i don t want to see india now now for my passage back
p00398_B,00398,B,yes as mr mcbryde was saying but it s much more the anglo indians themselves who are likely to get on adela s nerves she doesn t think they behave pleasantly to indians you see
p00399_B,00399,B,red nine on black ten
p00400_B,00400,B,i don t think adela ll ever be quite their sort she s much too individual
p00401_B,00401,B,but my dear boy a private conversation
p00402_B,00402,B,why should i be in the witness box
p00403_B,00403,B,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00404_B,00404,B,ronny ronny you re never going to pass it on to major callendar
p00405_B,00405,B,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00406_B,00406,B,i want my pack of patience cards
p00407_B,00407,B,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00408_B,00408,B,rather small with a little moustache and quick eyes he called out to me when i was in the dark part of the mosque about my shoes that was how we began talking he was afraid i had them on but i remembered luckily he told me about his children and then we walked back to the club he knows you well
p00409_B,00409,B,oh yes i think so except the callendars he doesn t care for the callendars at all
p00410_B,00410,B,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00411_B,00411,B,crocodiles down in it too how terrible what a terrible river what a wonderful river
p00412_B,00412,B,but my dear boy
p00413_B,00413,B,not talk about him why
p00414_B,00414,B,one knows people s characters as you call them i have heard both english and indians speak well of him and i felt it isn t the sort of thing he would do
p00415_B,00415,B,between the acts
p00416_B,00416,B,he didn t come into the club he said he wasn t allowed to
p00417_B,00417,B,a side issue a side issue how can it be that
p00418_B,00418,B,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00419_B,00419,B,i am all right as a matter of fact i have been looking at my return ticket it is interchangeable so i have a much larger choice of boats home than i thought
p00420_B,00420,B,your sentiments are those of a god
p00421_B,00421,B,oh how tedious trivial oh why is everything still my duty when shall i be free from your fuss was he in the cave and were you in the cave and on and on and unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and am i good and is he bad and are we saved and ending everything the echo
p00422_B,00422,B,ask her ask her yourself my dear boy
p00423_B,00423,B,i don t know what you mean dear
p00424_B,00424,B,and englishmen like posing as gods
p00425_B,00425,B,i m going to argue and indeed dictate the english are out here to be pleasant
p00426_B,00426,B,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00427_B,00427,B,pretty dear
p00428_B,00428,B,most feeble
p00429_B,00429,B,ah yes so the young man there said
p00430_B,00430,B,a doctor i don t know his name
p00431_B,00431,B,you never used to judge people like this at home
p00432_B,00432,B,a ghost
p00433_B,00433,B,how not true
p00434_B,00434,B,my body my miserable body why isn t it strong oh why can t i walk away and be gone why can t i finish my duties and be gone why do i get headaches and puff when i walk and all the time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and that to do in her way and everything sympathy and confusion and bearing one another s burdens why can t this be done and that be done in my way and they be done and i at peace why has anything to be done i cannot see why all this marriage marriage the human race would have become a single person centuries ago if marriage was any use and all this rubbish about love love in a church love in a cave as if there is the least difference and i held up from my business over such trifles
p00435_B,00435,B,oh it wouldn t be the weather
p00436_B,00436,B,will you play patience with your future mother in law dear adela or does it seem too tame
p00437_B,00437,B,she has started the machinery it will work to its end
p00438_B,00438,B,yes quite after the first moment
p00439_B,00439,B,because india is part of the earth and god has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant to each other god is love god has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show it and he is omnipresent even in india to see how we are succeeding
p00440_B,00440,B,i suppose so i suppose so
p00441_B,00441,B,well they must gossip sometime let them gossip
p00442_B,00442,B,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00443_B,00443,B,but she came out to be worried that s exactly why she s here she discussed it all on the boat we had a long talk when we went on shore at aden she knows you in play as she put it but not in work and she felt she must come and look round before she decided and before you decided she is very very fair minded
p00444_B,00444,B,i can t deny that what you say sounds very sensible but you really must not hand on to major callendar anything i have told you about doctor aziz
p00445_B,00445,B,an accident
p00446_B,00446,B,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00447_B,00447,B,what do you mean
p00448_B,00448,B,can t mother
p00449_B,00449,B,i have changed my mind
p00450_B,00450,B,oh so he told you that did he the major will be interested i wonder what was the aim of the remark
p00451_B,00451,B,nothing s private in india aziz knew that when he spoke out so don t you worry he had some motive in what he said my personal belief is that the remark wasn t true
p00452_B,00452,B,how do you make that out mother
p00453_B,00453,B,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00454_B,00454,B,there you go again mother i really can t explain every thing i don t want adela to be worried that s the fact she ll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly and all that sort of nonsense
p00455_B,00455,B,been there when
p00456_B,00456,B,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00457_B,00457,B,if the major heard i was disliked by any native subordinate of mine i should expect him to pass it on to me
p00458_B,00458,B,there s no point in all this here we are and we re going to stop and the country s got to put up with us gods or no gods oh look here what do you and adela want me to do go against my class against all the people i respect and admire out here lose such power as i have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn t pleasant you neither of you understand what work is or you ld never talk such eyewash i hate talking like this but one must occasionally it s morbidly sensitive to go on as adela and you do i noticed you both at the club to day after the burra sahib had been at all that trouble to amuse you i am out here to work mind to hold this wretched country by force i m not a missionary or a labour member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man i m just a servant of the government it s the profession you wanted me to choose myself and that s that we re not pleasant in india and we don t intend to be pleasant we ve something more important to do
p00459_B,00459,B,so you and he had a talk did you gather he was well disposed
p00460_B,00460,B,people are so odd out here and it s not like home one s always facing the footlights as the burra sahib said take a silly little example when adela went out to the boundary of the club compound and fielding followed her i saw mrs callendar notice it they notice everything until they re perfectly sure you re their sort
p00461_B,00461,B,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00462_B,00462,B,yes rather i must in fact
p00463_B,00463,B,you can t go to england in may as you agreed
p00464_B,00464,B,i wish you had pointed him out to me i can t make out who he is
p00465_B,00465,B,but mother you can t do that sort of thing
p00466_B,00466,B,oh good gracious not a mohammedan why ever didn t you tell me you d been talking to a native i was going all wrong
p00467_B,00467,B,what i say we re out here to do justice and keep the peace them s my sentiments india isn t a drawing room
p00468_B,00468,B,and most inconsiderate to adela
p00469_B,00469,B,there s nothing in india but the weather my dear mother it s the alpha and omega of the whole affair
p00470_B,00470,B,she is certainly ageing and i ought not to be vexed with anything she says
p00471_B,00471,B,it s the educated native s latest dodge they used to cringe but the younger generation believe in a show of manly independence they think it will pay better with the itinerant m p but whether the native swaggers or cringes there s always something behind every remark he makes always something and if nothing else he s trying to increase his izzat in plain anglo saxon to score of course there are exceptions
p00472_B,00472,B,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00473_B,00473,B,we re not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly
p00474_B,00474,B,you oughtn t to have answered
p00475_B,00475,B,yes perhaps but then people ld gossip
p00476_B,00476,B,feeble mother feeble
p00477_B,00477,B,who was he
p00478_B,00478,B,probably she s heard tales of the heat but of course i should pack her off to the hills every april i m not one to keep a wife grilling in the plains
p00479_B,00479,B,very well get them
p00480_B,00480,B,a doctor i know of no young doctor in chandrapore how odd what was he like
p00481_B,00481,B,india isn t home
p00482_B,00482,B,are you all right you appeared all right when i left
p00483_B,00483,B,he abused the major in order to impress you
p00484_B,00484,B,what do you want can you state it in simple language if so do
p00485_B,00485,B,what did i tell you i knew it last week oh how like a woman to worry over a side issue
p00486_B,00486,B,we can go into that later can t we
p00487_B,00487,B,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00488_B,00488,B,i meant generally did he seem to tolerate us the brutal conqueror the sundried bureaucrat that sort of thing
p00489_B,00489,B,i quite see that i suppose i ought to get off to my files now and you ll be going to bed
p00490_B,00490,B,when the animal runs into us the nawab loses his head deserts his unfortunate chauffeur intrudes upon miss derek no great crimes no great crimes but no white man would have done it
p00491_B,00491,B,i know that s so remarkable about her i suppose nothing s on her mind
p00492_B,00492,B,well we d better end this unexpected wrangle you appear to want to be left out of everything and that s enough
p00493_B,00493,B,i know
p00494_B,00494,B,in return please don t talk about aziz to adela
p00495_B,00495,B,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00496_B,00496,B,nothing no one hurt our excellent host awoke much rattled from his dreams appeared to think it was our fault and chanted exactly exactly
p00497_B,00497,B,india likes gods
p00498_B,00498,B,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening
p00499_B,00499,B,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00500_B,00500,B,the lieutenant governor may be my very good friend but i give him no trouble and all is over but i can be a thorn in mr turton s flesh and if he asks me i accept the invitation i shall come in from dilkusha specially though i have to postpone other business
p00501_B,00501,B,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p00502_B,00502,B,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00503_B,00503,B,it is easy to sympathize at a distance i value more the kind word that is spoken close to my ear mr turton has spoken it from whatever cause he speaks we hear i do not see why we need discuss it further
p00504_B,00504,B,i do not expect i shall make myself cheap i do not see why we should make ourselves cheap i do not see why we should the invitation is worded very graciously till tuesday then gentlemen all when i hope we may meet in the flower gardens of the club
p00505_B,00505,B,we have not all your sweet nature nawab bahadur nor your learning
p00506_B,00506,B,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00507_B,00507,B,pepper civil surgeon said so they hope to destroy us one by one they shall fail
p00508_B,00508,B,you will make yourself chip
p00509_B,00509,B,mr ram chand the nawab bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation i think
p00510_B,00510,B,mr ram chand
p00511_B,00511,B,mr mahmoud ali
p00512_B,00512,B,you wanted something not picturesque and we ve provided it what do you think of the aryan brother in a topi and spats the great point to remember is that no one who s here matters those who matter don t come isn t that so mrs turton
p00513_B,00513,B,the educated indians will be no good to us if there s a row it s simply not worth while conciliating them that s why they don t matter most of the people you see are seditious at heart and the rest ld run squealing the cultivator he s another story the pathan he s a man if you like but these people don t imagine they re india
p00514_B,00514,B,i didn t mean that
p00515_B,00515,B,absolutely true
p00516_B,00516,B,all right i said don t apologize
p00517_B,00517,B,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00518_B,00518,B,this isn t a purdah party
p00519_B,00519,B,please tell these ladies that i wish we could speak their language but we have only just come to their country
p00520_B,00520,B,i can t eat might i have a little brandy
p00521_B,00521,B,if i do break down it is of no consequence it would matter in some trials not in this i put it to myself in the following way i can really behave as i like cry be absurd i am sure to get my verdict unless mr das is most frightfully unjust
p00522_B,00522,B,i ll thank you this evening i m all to pieces now my echo has come back again badly
p00523_B,00523,B,but now we can talk how delightful
p00524_B,00524,B,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00525_B,00525,B,but mrs turton
p00526_B,00526,B,oh really

p00568_B,00568,B,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them
p00569_B,00569,B,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00570_B,00570,B,owing to my work and so on i don t get up much to the club
p00571_B,00571,B,i wouldn t worry about that
p00572_B,00572,B,i fear not
p00573_B,00573,B,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00574_B,00574,B,i don t go to that length
p00575_B,00575,B,how could she have known what we don t
p00576_B,00576,B,i ought to feel grateful to you i suppose but
p00577_B,00577,B,she s an old lady
p00578_B,00578,B,and i do like you so very much if i may say so
p00579_B,00579,B,we english do
p00580_B,00580,B,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too
p00581_B,00581,B,we will in england if i ever take home leave
p00582_B,00582,B,i know all about him i don t know him would you like him asked too
p00583_B,00583,B,if heaven existed
p00584_B,00584,B,i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am
p00585_B,00585,B,very well miss quested will thursday suit you
p00586_B,00586,B,oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair
p00587_B,00587,B,aziz was so fond of her too
p00588_B,00588,B,none why make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it
p00589_B,00589,B,quite a chance i have a scheme on now as a matter of fact
p00590_B,00590,B,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down
p00591_B,00591,B,i think he should come in this time do ask him to come
p00592_B,00592,B,not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical
p00593_B,00593,B,good bye miss quested
p00594_B,00594,B,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district
p00595_B,00595,B,the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends
p00596_B,00596,B,it ll get us to heaven
p00597_B,00597,B,i no longer want love
p00598_B,00598,B,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts
p00599_B,00599,B,not much
p00600_B,00600,B,i should be pleased but does mr heaslop wish it
p00601_B,00601,B,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00602_B,00602,B,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter
p00603_B,00603,B,do you care to meet one or two
p00604_B,00604,B,write to me when you get to england
p00605_B,00605,B,i don t expect gratitude i only thought you might care to hear what i have to say
p00606_B,00606,B,i don t know
p00607_B,00607,B,of course this death has been troubling me
p00608_B,00608,B,do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask
p00609_B,00609,B,i do so long to be alone she was my best friend far more to me than to him i can t bear to be with ronny i can t explain could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop after all
p00610_B,00610,B,how can that be
p00611_B,00611,B,i m glad for i like you let s meet again
p00612_B,00612,B,someone who was in another cave and followed me when the guide was looking away possibly
p00613_B,00613,B,do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now
p00614_B,00614,B,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps
p00615_B,00615,B,does he tell me to come out to him
p00616_B,00616,B,and nasty
p00617_B,00617,B,much the best thing to be in this place
p00618_B,00618,B,yes ronny is always hard worked
p00619_B,00619,B,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00620_B,00620,B,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made
p00621_B,00621,B,i do so hate mysteries
p00622_B,00622,B,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon
p00623_B,00623,B,let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know
p00624_B,00624,B,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son
p00625_B,00625,B,i know i know and we never get down from it i envy you being with indians
p00626_B,00626,B,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00627_B,00627,B,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does
p00628_B,00628,B,so do i
p00629_B,00629,B,far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced
p00630_B,00630,B,because the dead don t live again
p00631_B,00631,B,but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real
p00632_B,00632,B,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere
p00633_B,00633,B,ought i to join them
p00634_B,00634,B,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p00635_B,00635,B,no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it
p00636_B,00636,B,exactly what mr heaslop tells me if one doesn t worry how s one to understand
p00637_B,00637,B,i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it
p00638_B,00638,B,but i suppose you re not likely to do that yet
p00639_B,00639,B,mrs moore says he is so nice
p00640_B,00640,B,indeed it will and that morning we go to this indian lady s all the nice things are coming thursday
p00641_B,00641,B,but where am i to go in it
p00642_B,00642,B,telepathy possibly
p00643_B,00643,B,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00644_B,00644,B,i shall walk
p00645_B,00645,B,i shall often you have been excessively kind now that i m going i realize it i wish i could do something for you in return but i see you ve all you want
p00646_B,00646,B,will it
p00647_B,00647,B,do i like anyone though
p00648_B,00648,B,oh that would be very nice
p00649_B,00649,B,i dislike them not because i m english but from my own personal point of view
p00650_B,00650,B,so do i what does dr aziz say of me
p00651_B,00651,B,the guide
p00652_B,00652,B,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house
p00653_B,00653,B,i didn t ask him we are too much upset it s so complex not like what unhappiness is supposed to be each of us ought to be alone and think do come and see ronny again
p00654_B,00654,B,would it not interest you to hear my side
p00655_B,00655,B,why indeed
p00656_B,00656,B,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00657_B,00657,B,perhaps it was the guide
p00658_B,00658,B,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost
p00659_B,00659,B,very very much indeed it s what i long for this party to day makes me so angry and miserable i think my countrymen out here must be mad fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly you and mr turton and perhaps mr mcbryde are the only people who showed any common politeness the rest make me perfectly ashamed and it s got worse and worse oh just what we wanted to hear and do you know doctor aziz
p00660_B,00660,B,i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of
p00661_B,00661,B,oh nancy how topping oh nancy how killing i wish i could look at things like that
p00662_B,00662,B,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion
p00663_B,00663,B,does adela talk to you much i m so driven with work i don t see her as much as i hoped but i hope she finds things comfortable
p00664_B,00664,B,sir excuse me i did i mounted my bike and it bust in front of the cow hospital so i had to find a tonga

p00690_B,00690,B,even if this so what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go farther away or mine will start out of sympathy it has been so rough and wild this afternoon it spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club garden and had to be dragged back by four men english ladies and gentlemen looking on and the collector sahib himself taking a note but dr aziz i ll not take up your valuable time this will not interest you who have so many engagements and telegrams i am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when i was asked and where i was asked your absence i may remark drew commentaries
p00691_B,00691,B,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively
p00692_B,00692,B,dr aziz
p00693_B,00693,B,really
p00694_B,00694,B,is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella
p00695_B,00695,B,not even mogul emperors showed mercy until they received an apology

p00718_B,00718,B,his highness s private secretary probably
p00719_B,00719,B,i should think not do you know what deccani brahmans say that england conquered india from them from them mind and not from the moguls is not that like their cheek they have even bribed it to appear in text books for they are so subtle and immensely rich professor godbole must be quite unlike all other deccani brahmans from all i can hear say a most sincere chap
p00720_B,00720,B,dinner this is most unlucky i forgot i have promised to dine with das
p00721_B,00721,B,if i m biking in english dress starch collar hat with ditch they take no notice when i wear a fez they cry your lamp s out lord curzon did not consider this when he urged natives of india to retain their picturesque costumes hooray stud s gone in sometimes i shut my eyes and dream i have splendid clothes again and am riding into battle behind alamgir mr fielding must not india have been beautiful then with the mogul empire at its height and alamgir reigning at delhi upon the peacock throne
p00722_B,00722,B,of course not but the word exists and is convenient all men are my brothers and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife

p00724_B,00724,B,sound reasoning i have not got my bicycle but i am seen too often in your carriage i am thought to take advantage of your generosity by mr ram chand

p00735_B,00735,B,oh it s nothing she was not a highly educated woman or even beautiful but put it away you would have seen her so why should you not see her photograph
p00736_B,00736,B,cyril you sometimes make a sensible remark that will do for poetry for the present let us now return to your english visit
p00737_B,00737,B,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00738_B,00738,B,you should never have left them
p00739_B,00739,B,don t trouble i ll bike

p00741_B,00741,B,old story of we will rob every man and rape every woman from peshawar to calcutta i suppose which you get some nobody to repeat and then quote every week in the pioneer in order to frighten us into retaining you we know india shall be a nation no foreigners of any sort hindu and moslem and sikh and all shall be one hurrah hurrah for india hurrah hurrah down with the english anyhow that s certain clear out you fellows double quick i say we may hate one another but we hate you most if i don t make you go ahmed will karim will if it s fifty five hundred years we shall get rid of you yes we shall drive every blasted englishman into the sea and then and then you and i shall be friends

p00753_B,00753,B,why are you not married
p00754_B,00754,B,the fault is entirely mine but i believe you i believe mohammed latif shall be severely punished for inventing this
p00755_B,00755,B,mrs moore did not mention that to me among her plans
p00756_B,00756,B,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness

p00809_B,00809,B,explain in detail
p00810_B,00810,B,cyril cyril don t leave me

p00820_B,00820,B,i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental
p00821_B,00821,B,i thought you might end in england
p00822_B,00822,B,i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time
p00823_B,00823,B,as what
p00824_B,00824,B,to those other children
p00825_B,00825,B,why when you yourself are an atheist
p00826_B,00826,B,this evening will do for schoolmastery i should go straight to the minto now the cholera looks bad we begin to have local cases as well as imported in fact the whole of life is somewhat sad the new civil surgeon is the same as the last but does not yet dare to be that is all any administrative change amounts to all my suffering has won nothing for us but look here cyril while i remember it there s gossip about you as well as mcbryde they say that you and miss quested became also rather too intimate friends to speak perfectly frankly they say you and she have been guilty of impropriety
p00827_B,00827,B,cyril that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin it is raising up enemies against you on all sides and makes me feel excessively uneasy
p00828_B,00828,B,not the least i ll send an embrocation over to the guest house i heard you were settled in there
p00829_B,00829,B,this is a very useless conversation i consider
p00830_B,00830,B,i don t know
p00831_B,00831,B,no the afghans my own ancestors
p00832_B,00832,B,well this indifference is what the oriental will never understand
p00833_B,00833,B,i am looking though it gets a bit dark i see cyril fielding to be a very nice chap indeed and my best friend but in some ways a fool you think that by letting miss quested off easily i shall make a better reputation for myself and indians generally no no it will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion officially i have decided to have nothing more to do with british india as a matter of fact i shall seek service in some moslem state such as hyderabad bhopal where englishmen cannot insult me any more don t counsel me otherwise
p00834_B,00834,B,i have been here such a short time and always in the bazaar no wonder you have never seen me and i wonder you know my name i say mr fielding
p00835_B,00835,B,there goes a queer chap i trust he won t come to grief
p00836_B,00836,B,that s all very well but you spoke against morality also and you said you had come to take other people s jobs all that was very unwise this is an awful place for scandal why actually one of your own pupils was listening
p00837_B,00837,B,i see you re worrying let s talk of other things miss quested was always to do what she wished it was our arrangement i see you are worrying on my account but really i don t mind i never notice trifles
p00838_B,00838,B,my dear chap officially they call it gokul ashtami all the state offices are closed but how else should it concern you and me
p00839_B,00839,B,except that i ate too much i say panna lal and callendar ll get the sack
p00840_B,00840,B,very well and we have no use for you
p00841_B,00841,B,yes yes but you didn t contradict what i said so i thought it was true oh dear east and west most misleading will you please put your little rotter down at his hospital
p00842_B,00842,B,it is because you can say and feel such a remark as that that i show you the photograph it is beyond the power of most men it is because you behave well while i behave badly that i show it you i never expected you to come back just now when i called you i thought mr fielding no one can ever realize how much kindness we indians need we do not even realize it ourselves but we know when it has been given we do not forget though we may seem to kindness more kindness and even after that more kindness i assure you it is the only hope we can t build up india except on what we feel what is the use of all these reforms and conciliation committees for mohurram and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry it another route and councils of notables and official parties where the english sneer at our skins
p00843_B,00843,B,this picnic is nothing to do with english or indian it is an expedition of friends
p00844_B,00844,B,yes you re out of it my poor chap no miss quested for mr fielding however she was not beautiful she has practically no breasts if you come to think of it for the city magistrate they shall be sufficient perhaps and he for her for you i shall arrange a lady with breasts like mangoes
p00845_B,00845,B,it will be arranged a conference of oriental statesmen
p00846_B,00846,B,it has been i believe absolutely what you say and of that there need be no further question
p00847_B,00847,B,if you are right there is no point in any friendship it all comes down to give and take or give and return which is disgusting and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow so materialistic
p00848_B,00848,B,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00849_B,00849,B,i was a child when you knew me first everyone was my friend then the friend a persian expression for god but i do not want to be a religious poet either
p00850_B,00850,B,i have given you list after list of the people who cannot be trusted in this city in your position i should have the sense to know i was surrounded by enemies you observe i speak in a low voice it is because i see your sais is new how do i know he isn t a spy every third servant is a spy
p00851_B,00851,B,is she wealthy i depute you to find out
p00852_B,00852,B,is she a post impressionist
p00853_B,00853,B,i see your trick i want revenge on them why should i be insulted and suffer and the contents of my pockets read and my wife s photograph taken to the police station also i want the money to educate my little boys as i explained to her
p00854_B,00854,B,exactly got a cigarette
p00855_B,00855,B,let them sing it
p00856_B,00856,B,so you and madamsell adela used to amuse one another in the evening naughty boy
p00857_B,00857,B,if the weather lifts we want to see your torchlight procession from the water this evening i wrote to godbole about it but he has taken no notice it s a place of the dead
p00858_B,00858,B,i hope she wasn t ill
p00859_B,00859,B,it s difficult to explain i never really understood or liked them except an occasional scrap of godbole does the old fellow still say
p00860_B,00860,B,exactly and no oars
p00861_B,00861,B,to whom
p00862_B,00862,B,oh i wish you wouldn t make that kind of remark it is the one thing in you i can t put up with
p00863_B,00863,B,i can t explain because it isn t in words at all but why do my wife and her brother like hinduism though they take no interest in its forms they won t talk to me about this they know i think a certain side of their lives is a mistake and are shy that s why i wish you would talk to them for at all events you re oriental
p00864_B,00864,B,aziz you have forgiven me the stupid remark i made this morning
p00865_B,00865,B,who do you want instead of the english the japanese
p00866_B,00866,B,the preposterous letter you allowed mahmoud ali to write for you
p00867_B,00867,B,good god why the girl s a prig
p00868_B,00868,B,let us talk about poetry you people are sadly circumstanced whatever are you to write about you cannot say for evermore we know it s faded yet you can t have patriotic poetry of the india my india type when it s nobody s india
p00869_B,00869,B,if i have time it will be strange seeing her in hampstead
p00870_B,00870,B,i wrote beforehand to the durbar and asked if a visit was convenient i was told it was and arranged my tour accordingly but the guest house servants appear to have no definite instructions we can t get any eggs also my wife wants to go out in the boat
p00871_B,00871,B,aziz i wish you would talk to my wife she too believes that the marabar is wiped out
p00872_B,00872,B,is there a path off the top
p00873_B,00873,B,who on earth is mr quested
p00874_B,00874,B,enough to see my friends
p00875_B,00875,B,well are you
p00876_B,00876,B,who on earth do you suppose i ve married
p00877_B,00877,B,i don t feel their absence i don t want them weeping around my death bed and being polite about me afterwards which i believe is the general notion i d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child other people can have children no obligation with england getting so chock a block and overrunning india for jobs
p00878_B,00878,B,because i have more or less come through without it i was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if i can make it interesting enough the lady i liked wouldn t marry me that is the main point but that s fifteen years ago and now means nothing
p00879_B,00879,B,nothing of the sort put your hat straight and take my arm i ll see you through
p00880_B,00880,B,plenty of indians travel light too saddhus and such it s one of the things i admire about your country any man can travel light until he has a wife or children that s part of my case against marriage i m a holy man minus the holiness hand that on to your three spies and tell them to put it in their pipes i can t be sacked from my job because my job s education i believe in teaching people to be individuals and to understand other individuals it s the only thing i do believe in at government college i mix it up with trigonometry and so on when i m a saddhu i shall mix it up with something else you might tell your servant to bring my horse he doesn t seem to appreciate my urdu
p00881_B,00881,B,did she think they were your brothers
p00882_B,00882,B,when would you like the carriage
p00883_B,00883,B,jump in ralph
p00884_B,00884,B,no we won t think about it from her point of view mau has been a success it calmed her both of them suffer from restlessness she found something soothing some solution of her queer troubles here do you know anything about this krishna business
p00885_B,00885,B,it s beginning at the wrong end isn t it i know but institutions and the governments don t
p00886_B,00886,B,none
p00887_B,00887,B,come in with it if you don t mind the unconventionality

p00898_B,00898,B,i should have thought you could it sounds common sense you can t eat your cake and have it even in the world of the spirit
p00899_B,00899,B,something that the hindus have perhaps found
p00900_B,00900,B,why can t we be friends now it s what i want it s what you want
p00901_B,00901,B,not if you re wearing it yourself
p00902_B,00902,B,you see aziz the circumstances also the girl was still engaged to heaslop also i never felt
p00903_B,00903,B,blast
p00904_B,00904,B,he wants the past back too but not precisely alamgir
p00905_B,00905,B,well you hurt me by saying it good night
p00906_B,00906,B,really i don t know why you pay me this great compliment aziz but i do appreciate it
p00907_B,00907,B,hamidullah s right they are much nicer in england there s something that doesn t suit them out here
p00908_B,00908,B,you know me by sight then
p00909_B,00909,B,in the course of a long talk with miss quested
p00910_B,00910,B,what s happened
p00911_B,00911,B,i m sorry to say mrs moore s dead
p00912_B,00912,B,i knew these women would make trouble
p00913_B,00913,B,oh leave it alone like all gossip it s merely one of those half alive things that try to crowd out real life take no notice it ll vanish like poor old mrs moore s tombs
p00914_B,00914,B,it s the old mother s doing she was afraid her dear boy would choose for himself so she brought out the girl on purpose and flung them together until it happened
p00915_B,00915,B,but you haven t got your bicycle my carriage fetched you let it take you away
p00916_B,00916,B,but you saw them get down safe
p00917_B,00917,B,we haven t discussed poetry for two seconds
p00918_B,00918,B,i ve stamped on my last collar stud
p00919_B,00919,B,you can talk to miss quested about the peacock throne if you like she s artistic they say
p00920_B,00920,B,so she probably is but i can t marry her if i wanted to for she has just become engaged to the city magistrate
p00921_B,00921,B,where is he then
p00922_B,00922,B,but how i suppose the guide helped her
p00923_B,00923,B,yes and what do they say free our women and india will be free try it my lad free your own lady in the first place and see who ll wash ahmed karim and jamila s faces a nice situation
p00924_B,00924,B,no i d willingly tell you if i had
p00925_B,00925,B,if you are this must be cleared up later on
p00926_B,00926,B,don t use such exaggerated phrases
p00927_B,00927,B,i have not heard of other children
p00928_B,00928,B,however did you make such a mistake it s almost unbelievable i should think i wrote you half a dozen times mentioning my wife by name miss quested what an extraordinary notion miss quested is our best friend she introduced us but what an amazing notion aziz we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on it is clearly some devilry of mahmoud ali s he knows perfectly well i married miss moore he called her heaslop s sister in his insolent letter to me
p00929_B,00929,B,as far as i do mind i travel light
p00930_B,00930,B,many thanks

p00936_B,00936,B,why in hell does one wear collars at all
p00937_B,00937,B,i do worry on your account i consider they have been impolite she had no right to dash away from your party and miss derek had no right to abet her
p00938_B,00938,B,if you won t talk about the marabar to stella why won t you talk to ralph he is a wise boy really and same metaphor he rides a little behind her though with her
p00939_B,00939,B,i knew her so slightly
p00940_B,00940,B,how do you do aziz after all this time i heard you were settled in here i suppose a couple of stings don t signify
p00941_B,00941,B,no you won t
p00942_B,00942,B,she goes on and on as if she s at a lecture trying ever so hard to understand india and life and occasionally taking a note
p00943_B,00943,B,it s often done so in the past
p00944_B,00944,B,are you not coming down yourself how goes it aziz
p00945_B,00945,B,the sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited they would ruin her they are perfectly preposterous look here

p00947_B,00947,B,what s that
p00948_B,00948,B,we had a very different reception both at mudkul and deora they were kindness itself at deora the maharajah and maharani wanted us to see everything

p00953_B,00953,B,will there be any objection to english people watching the procession
p00954_B,00954,B,willingly what subject
p00955_B,00955,B,oh i don t know her but she struck me as one of the more pathetic products of western education she depresses me
p00956_B,00956,B,i know you very well by name
p00957_B,00957,B,but you do you take them to a picnic
p00958_B,00958,B,very much
p00959_B,00959,B,you are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life when i knew you first you used it as an incantation
p00960_B,00960,B,yes but the scale the scale you always get the scale wrong my dear fellow a pity there is this rumour but such a very small pity so small that we may as well talk of something else
p00961_B,00961,B,not mrs moore and miss quested

p00990_B,00990,B,as dismay and anxiety
p00991_B,00991,B,you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz

p01018_B,01018,B,be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one

p01027_B,01027,B,she is not in chandrapore just now
p01028_B,01028,B,ah you have heard the name of akbar good hamidullah whom you shall meet will tell you that akbar is the greatest of all i say which makes hamidullah cry but babur always repented afterwards which makes the entire difference and akbar never repented of the new religion he invented instead of the holy koran
p01029_B,01029,B,yes indeed three
p01030_B,01030,B,perhaps it is a circular train and goes back to chandrapore without a break who knows
p01031_B,01031,B,good bye miss quested you ll jolly jolly well not forget those caves won t you i ll fix the whole show up in a jiffy
p01032_B,01032,B,on which my heartiest congratulations
p01033_B,01033,B,not for my thick head
p01034_B,01034,B,mohammed latif by the way what is in these caves brother why are we all going to see them
p01035_B,01035,B,that you shall tell me when i return to chandrapore whatever disgraces i bring upon myself you remain my guests
p01036_B,01036,B,i speak now as a doctor no
p01037_B,01037,B,visitors like you are too rare
p01038_B,01038,B,then you are told a lie come along
p01039_B,01039,B,i always enjoy conversing about the moguls it is the chief pleasure i know you see those first six emperors were all most wonderful men and as soon as one of them is mentioned no matter which i forget everything else in the world except the other five you could not find six such kings in all the countries of the earth not i mean coming one after the other father son
p01040_B,01040,B,because my ancestors came down with him from afghanistan they joined him at herat he also had often no more elephants than one none sometimes but he never ceased showing hospitality when he fought or hunted or ran away he would always stop for a time among hills just like us he would never let go of hospitality and pleasure and if there was only a little food he would have it arranged nicely and if only one musical instrument he would compel it to play a beautiful tune i take him as my ideal he is the poor gentleman and he became a great king
p01041_B,01041,B,i thought we would eat this before our caves and breakfast after
p01042_B,01042,B,impossible take back such a terrible remark
p01043_B,01043,B,mohammed latif here is my cousin mr mohammed latif oh no don t shake hands he is an indian of the old fashioned sort he prefers to salaam there i told you so mohammed latif how beautifully you salaam see he hasn t understood he knows no english
p01044_B,01044,B,this breakfast did you think i should treat you so strangely
p01045_B,01045,B,why naturally i adore them i suppose so
p01046_B,01046,B,oh please do not mention a little thing like that is there anything else i may tell you about my country
p01047_B,01047,B,there honestly is none we are by nature a most informal people
p01048_B,01048,B,miss quested fine but foolish you keep your religion i mine that is the best nothing embraces the whole of india nothing nothing and that was akbar s mistake
p01049_B,01049,B,you are certain to be happy with any relative of mrs moore s
p01050_B,01050,B,i am to blame i am the host
p01051_B,01051,B,alamgir oh yes he was of course the more pious but babur never in his whole life did he betray a friend so i can only think of him this morning and you know how he died he laid down his life for his son a death far more difficult than battle they were caught in the heat they should have gone back to kabul for the bad weather but could not for reasons of state and at agra humayun fell sick babur walked round the bed three times and said and he did bear it away the fever left his son and came to him instead and he died that is why i prefer babur to alamgir i ought not to do so but i do however i mustn t delay you i see you are ready to start
p01052_B,01052,B,ralph and stella yes i know everything about them but we must not forget to visit our caves one of the dreams of my life is accomplished in having you both here as my guests you cannot imagine how you have honoured me i feel like the emperor babur
p01053_B,01053,B,i know
p01054_B,01054,B,one one in my own particular case
p01055_B,01055,B,yes indeed do come and see my wife
p01056_B,01056,B,slack hindus they have no idea of society i know them very well because of a doctor at the hospital such a slack unpunctual fellow it is as well you did not go to their house for it would give you a wrong idea of india nothing sanitary i think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send
p01057_B,01057,B,and he is such a horrible servant antony you can go we don t want you
p01058_B,01058,B,did you see the reflection of his match rather pretty

p01065_B,01065,B,but i shall it s inevitable i can t avoid the label what i do hope to avoid is the mentality women like some women are so well ungenerous and snobby about indians and i should feel too ashamed for words if i turned like them but and here s my difficulty there s nothing special about me nothing specially good or strong which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them i ve most lamentable defects that s why i want akbar s universal religion or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible do you see what i mean
p01066_B,01066,B,nice creature he is
p01067_B,01067,B,good morning good morning put on your own

p01081_B,01081,B,i m afraid i can t do that
p01082_B,01082,B,oh do you feel that dr aziz i hope you re not right there will have to be something universal in this country i don t say religion for i m not religious but something or how else are barriers to be broken down take my own case i don t know whether you happen to have heard but i m going to marry mr heaslop

p01099_B,01099,B,he has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic
p01100_B,01100,B,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p01101_B,01101,B,adela she s never been in a hurry in her life
p01102_B,01102,B,oh do you think so mr fielding
p01103_B,01103,B,i do not know

p01116_B,01116,B,but i will send you up a few healthy sweets i will give myself that pleasure
p01117_B,01117,B,he arrived at the european guest house perhaps at least possibly
p01118_B,01118,B,never be angry with me i am as far as my limitations permit your true friend besides it is my holy festival
p01119_B,01119,B,oh no oh no
p01120_B,01120,B,well why are they so famous we all talk of the famous marabar caves perhaps that is our empty brag
p01121_B,01121,B,mangoes mangoes
p01122_B,01122,B,did he since when
p01123_B,01123,B,describe them to this lady then
p01124_B,01124,B,sorry
p01125_B,01125,B,still they are ornamented in some way
p01126_B,01126,B,miss quested professor godbole s sweets are delicious they will give you a real indian treat ah in my poor position i can give you nothing
p01127_B,01127,B,come along up and join us mr heaslop sit down till your mother turns up he may not understand that allow me
p01128_B,01128,B,why did you not tell me your silence plunged me into a pretty pickle
p01129_B,01129,B,they are immensely holy no doubt
p01130_B,01130,B,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p01131_B,01131,B,it will be a great honour there is an entrance in the rock which you enter and through the entrance is the cave
p01132_B,01132,B,oh no not at all at elephanta there are sculptures of siva and parvati there are no sculptures at marabar
p01133_B,01133,B,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p01134_B,01134,B,no not large
p01135_B,01135,B,i may sing now
p01136_B,01136,B,something like the caves at elephanta
p01137_B,01137,B,no i ve not even heard of them
p01138_B,01138,B,are they large caves
p01139_B,01139,B,do describe them professor godbole
p01140_B,01140,B,we hear nothing interesting up at the club only tennis and ridiculous gossip
p01141_B,01141,B,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p01142_B,01142,B,don t trouble to come mother we re just starting
p01143_B,01143,B,well i m the sun dried bureaucrat no doubt still i don t like to see an english girl left smoking with two indians
p01144_B,01144,B,what should have upset his precious nerves
p01145_B,01145,B,let him go
p01146_B,01146,B,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison
p01147_B,01147,B,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same
p01148_B,01148,B,i am most frightfully cut up
p01149_B,01149,B,thanks so much what was that
p01150_B,01150,B,yes alas
p01151_B,01151,B,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing
p01152_B,01152,B,godbole is aziz innocent or guilty
p01153_B,01153,B,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something
p01154_B,01154,B,well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one
p01155_B,01155,B,the news has not reached you yet i can see
p01156_B,01156,B,a name a name for a school
p01157_B,01157,B,you re preaching that evil and good are the same
p01158_B,01158,B,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz
p01159_B,01159,B,yes yes
p01160_B,01160,B,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth
p01161_B,01161,B,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs
p01162_B,01162,B,so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know
p01163_B,01163,B,i will explain in detail it was a religious song i placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden i say to shri krishna the god refuses to come i grow humble and say he refuses to come this is repeated several times the song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present hour which is the evening
p01164_B,01164,B,and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school
p01165_B,01165,B,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us
p01166_B,01166,B,that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt
p01167_B,01167,B,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both
p01168_B,01168,B,i cannot say i was not present
p01169_B,01169,B,oh yes
p01170_B,01170,B,yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known
p01171_B,01171,B,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground
p01172_B,01172,B,oh yes that is all round the college

p01191_B,01191,B,a smash sahib that would not have taken place had he obeyed and taken us gangavati side instead of marabar
p01192_B,01192,B,ah now i begin to understand

p01206_B,01206,B,nussu will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle i shall despatch him with all possible speed meanwhile repair my car
p01207_B,01207,B,sahib says hyena

p01209_B,01209,B,we ran into a hyena
p01210_B,01210,B,really i had no idea
p01211_B,01211,B,well that s good
p01212_B,01212,B,it s just a trick and they happened to pull it off now one sees why they had mahmoud ali just to make a scene on the chance it is his speciality
p01213_B,01213,B,can you give us a lift
p01214_B,01214,B,yes old girl
p01215_B,01215,B,i m afraid it s very upsetting for you
p01216_B,01216,B,how absolutely rotten
p01217_B,01217,B,mr heaslop how disgraceful dragging in your dear mother
p01218_B,01218,B,isn t it all queer
p01219_B,01219,B,but how putrid
p01220_B,01220,B,yes indeed
p01221_B,01221,B,not the least i don t mind it
p01222_B,01222,B,don t worry about me i m much better than i was i don t feel the least faint i shall be all right and thank you all thank you thank you for your kindness
p01223_B,01223,B,take me too
p01224_B,01224,B,i will sit in front
p01225_B,01225,B,i would scarcely call her wrong a native state a hindu state the wife of a ruler of a hindu state may beyond doubt be a most excellent lady and let it not be for a moment supposed that i suggest anything against the character of her highness the maharani of mudkul but i fear she will be uneducated i fear she will be superstitious indeed how could she be otherwise what opportunity of education has such a lady had oh superstition is terrible terrible oh it is the great defect in our indian character oh it is the duty of each and every citizen to shake superstition off and though i have little experience of hindu states and none of this particular one namely mudkul the ruler i fancy has a salute of but eleven guns yet i cannot imagine that they have been as successful as british india where we see reason and orderliness spreading in every direction like a most health giving flood
p01226_B,01226,B,heh what about me
p01227_B,01227,B,now what s all this i m not an omnibus i ve a harmonium and two dogs in here with me as it is i ll take three of you if one ll sit in front and nurse a pug no more
p01228_B,01228,B,i don t believe in these people letting you down if i didn t snatch like the devil i should be nowhere he doesn t want the car silly fool surely it s to the credit of his state i should be seen about in it at chandrapore during my leave he ought to look at it that way anyhow he s got to look at it that way my maharani s different my maharani s a dear that s her fox terrier poor little devil i fished them out both with the driver imagine taking dogs to a chiefs conference as sensible as taking chiefs perhaps the harmonium the harmonium s my little mistake i own they rather had me over the harmonium i meant it to stop on the train oh lor they always sack me before that happens and then i get another job the whole of india seethes with maharanis and ranis and begums who clamour for such as me
p01229_B,01229,B,then hop in i ve no notion who you are
p01230_B,01230,B,heh no what about my dinner i can t be left alone all the night
p01231_B,01231,B,i never feel anything else nancy i shall get through but it s awful awful
p01232_B,01232,B,i understand those big people are not particularly interesting
p01233_B,01233,B,ronny i should like to take back what i said on the maidan
p01234_B,01234,B,i don t think so nancy and i seem able to do nothing for myself
p01235_B,01235,B,but you re strictly forbidden to talk like that you re wonderful
p01236_B,01236,B,ah there you re wrong they re priceless
p01237_B,01237,B,to drive them elsewhere
p01238_B,01238,B,kill flies
p01239_B,01239,B,huzoor they return
p01240_B,01240,B,huzoor those are flies
p01241_B,01241,B,huzoor
p01242_B,01242,B,glasses and a new teapot will similarly be required also for myself a coat
p01243_B,01243,B,driven elsewhere they always return
p01244_B,01244,B,good do it
p01245_B,01245,B,look at those flies on the ceiling why have you not drowned them
p01246_B,01246,B,good good they are excellent but why have i called you
p01247_B,01247,B,you must make some arrangement against flies that is why you are my servant good very good now what have you to do
p01248_B,01248,B,like all evil things when he breaks a plate does it become two plates
p01249_B,01249,B,when a doctor falls ill it is a serious matter
p01250_B,01250,B,aziz aziz my dear boy we must be going we are already late get well quickly for i do not know what our little circle would do without you
p01251_B,01251,B,when an engineer falls ill it is equally important
p01252_B,01252,B,that is exactly my own view
p01253_B,01253,B,oh yes we are all jolly important our salaries prove it
p01254_B,01254,B,dr aziz took tea with our principal last thursday afternoon professor godbole who also attended has sickened too which seems rather a curious thing sir does it not
p01255_B,01255,B,humbug
p01256_B,01256,B,add mine to them
p01257_B,01257,B,why don t you answer rafi you re the great authority
p01258_B,01258,B,yes rafi s the great man rafi is the sherlock holmes of chandrapore speak up rafi
p01259_B,01259,B,and sir accept mine
p01260_B,01260,B,diarrh a
p01261_B,01261,B,if this is so this is a very serious thing this is scarcely the end of march why have i not been informed
p01262_B,01262,B,oh yes both hindus there we have it they hang together like flies and keep everything dark rafi come here sit down tell me all the details is there vomiting also
p01263_B,01263,B,that settles it in twenty four hours he will be dead
p01264_B,01264,B,dr panna lal attends him sir
p01265_B,01265,B,oh yes indeed sir and the serious pains
p01266_B,01266,B,forgive my mistakes
p01267_B,01267,B,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p01268_B,01268,B,all illness proceeds from hindus
p01269_B,01269,B,don t talk to him like that he doesn t want it and he doesn t want three chairs he s not three englishmen rafi come here sit down again i m delighted you could come with mr hamidullah my dear boy it will help me to recover seeing you
p01270_B,01270,B,i shall not forget those affectionate words
p01271_B,01271,B,thank you mr syed mohammed i will
p01272_B,01272,B,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p01273_B,01273,B,and how much illness there is in the city
p01274_B,01274,B,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p01275_B,01275,B,here he lies
p01276_B,01276,B,we know how busy you are
p01277_B,01277,B,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p01278_B,01278,B,it is only my duty
p01279_B,01279,B,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p01280_B,01280,B,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p01281_B,01281,B,dr aziz dr aziz i come to enquire your hand also please some temperature
p01282_B,01282,B,yes that is true
p01283_B,01283,B,h morrhoids
p01284_B,01284,B,it is only a boy
p01285_B,01285,B,i think not much
p01286_B,01286,B,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p01287_B,01287,B,even boys must learn
p01288_B,01288,B,it is not the end of time it is scarcely ten thirty ha ha gentlemen if i may be allowed to say a few words what an interesting talk also thankfulness and gratitude to mr fielding in the first place teaches our sons and gives them all the great benefits of his experience and judgment
p01289_B,01289,B,some he should remain in bed how is stomach how head
p01290_B,01290,B,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p01291_B,01291,B,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p01292_B,01292,B,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p01293_B,01293,B,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p01294_B,01294,B,nor you the advantage of conducting their cases in the courts any longer
p01295_B,01295,B,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p01296_B,01296,B,oh indeed oh yes perhaps he has not the advantage of a relative in the prosperity printing press
p01297_B,01297,B,fetch my sais rafi there s a good chap
p01298_B,01298,B,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p01299_B,01299,B,oh that is true how true
p01300_B,01300,B,does mr fielding think it s true
p01301_B,01301,B,none chuck em out
p01302_B,01302,B,mr amritrao have you considered what sum miss quested ought to pay as compensation
p01303_B,01303,B,i guess they do i got in first
p01304_B,01304,B,quite so heaslop ought never to have let her go and he knows it shall we be off
p01305_B,01305,B,it will come
p01306_B,01306,B,you go rather too far there the poor old lady s evidence could have had no value shout and shriek mahmoud ali as he will she couldn t see through the kawa dol even if she had wanted to only miss quested could have saved him
p01307_B,01307,B,good bye then my dear hamidullah we must drop the mr now give aziz my love when you see him and tell him to keep calm calm calm i shall go back to the college now if you want me ring me up if you don t don t for i shall be very busy
p01308_B,01308,B,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested
p01309_B,01309,B,don t complicate let the cards play themselves we re bound to win there s nothing else we can do she will never be able to substantiate the charge
p01310_B,01310,B,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p01311_B,01311,B,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p01312_B,01312,B,it s a question i can t get my mind on to i m out here personally because i needed a job i cannot tell you why england is here or whether she ought to be here it s beyond me
p01313_B,01313,B,it depends what you call yes yes i suppose morality does decline
p01314_B,01314,B,she died at sea
p01315_B,01315,B,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p01316_B,01316,B,at once
p01317_B,01317,B,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p01318_B,01318,B,he s not annoyed and if he was what does it matter
p01319_B,01319,B,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p01320_B,01320,B,presumably
p01321_B,01321,B,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p01322_B,01322,B,well i don t believe in providence
p01323_B,01323,B,first and foremost the question of bail why drag in him though
p01324_B,01324,B,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p01325_B,01325,B,gladly in a minute
p01326_B,01326,B,i m delighted to be here too that s my answer there s my only excuse i can t tell you anything about fairness it mayn t have been fair i should have been born i take up some other fellow s air don t i whenever i breathe still i m glad it s happened and i m glad i m out here however big a badmash one is if one s happy in consequence that is some justification
p01327_B,01327,B,love is of no value in a witness as a barrister ought to know but i see there is about to be an esmiss esmoor legend at chandrapore my dear hamidullah and i will not impede its growth
p01328_B,01328,B,the educated thoughtful people i should say so though they don t like the name the truth is that the west doesn t bother much over belief and disbelief in these days fifty years ago or even when you and i were young much more fuss was made
p01329_B,01329,B,yes definitely
p01330_B,01330,B,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p01331_B,01331,B,we hear sir that your mother has died may we ask where the cable came from
p01332_B,01332,B,then excuse me again is it fair an englishman should occupy one when indians are available of course i mean nothing personally personally we are delighted you should be here and we benefit greatly by this frank talk
p01333_B,01333,B,let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear they really are intolerable dawdling there ah well fielding you don t believe in providence i remember i do this is heaslop s punishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing our alibi
p01334_B,01334,B,ah ah has some evidence come
p01335_B,01335,B,she loved aziz he says also india and he loved her
p01336_B,01336,B,at a crisis the english are really unequalled
p01337_B,01337,B,it was insulting of him not to come in
p01338_B,01338,B,oh no we must hit with all our strength when i saw my friend s private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman i said to myself amritrao is the man to clear up this
p01339_B,01339,B,oh really mrs moore i m sorry
p01340_B,01340,B,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours
p01341_B,01341,B,well qualified indians also need jobs in the educational
p01342_B,01342,B,excuse the question but if this is the case how is england justified in holding india
p01343_B,01343,B,the heat i suppose
p01344_B,01344,B,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p01345_B,01345,B,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p01346_B,01346,B,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p01347_B,01347,B,ah yes mr fielding but when once an indian has been arrested we do not know where it will stop you are very good to greet me in this public fashion i appreciate it but mr fielding nothing convinces a magistrate except evidence did mr mcbryde make any remark when my card came in do you think my application annoyed him will prejudice him against my friend at all if so i will gladly retire
p01348_B,01348,B,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say
p01349_B,01349,B,may is no month to allow an old lady to travel in
p01350_B,01350,B,no no the existence of providence
p01351_B,01351,B,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p01352_B,01352,B,ah it s all very well for you to speak like that but we have to live in this country
p01353_B,01353,B,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p01354_B,01354,B,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow
p01355_B,01355,B,and those englishmen who are not delighted to be in india have they no excuse
p01356_B,01356,B,oh this is unbearable
p01357_B,01357,B,and does not morality also decline
p01358_B,01358,B,good bye my dear fielding and you actually are on our side against your own people
p01359_B,01359,B,but how then can you believe in god
p01360_B,01360,B,i don t believe in god
p01361_B,01361,B,oh that is true how true
p01362_B,01362,B,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p01363_B,01363,B,come along we tire the invalid in either case
p01364_B,01364,B,i quite understand
p01365_B,01365,B,godbole s pujah did it
p01366_B,01366,B,i don t know whether this suits you but anyhow you re safe
p01367_B,01367,B,master says keep near the ladies all the morning
p01368_B,01368,B,master told me to come
p01369_B,01369,B,well your ladies won t have you do get rid of him dr aziz
p01370_B,01370,B,mistress tells you to go
p01371_B,01371,B,you spick lie
p01372_B,01372,B,i will discuss philosophy with him
p01373_B,01373,B,merciful god
p01374_B,01374,B,i spick a lie oh jolly good isn t he a funny old man we will have great jokes with him later he does all sorts of little things he is not nearly as stupid as you think and awfully poor it s lucky ours is a large family but you get inside make yourselves at home yes you lie down excuse me now i must meet our other two guests
p01375_B,01375,B,that will be kind of you but the servants are even more important we must not convey an impression of disorganization it can be done and i expect you to do it
p01376_B,01376,B,we re monkeys don t worry mr fielding mr fielding
p01377_B,01377,B,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p01378_B,01378,B,aziz can i have a drink
p01379_B,01379,B,on what charge do you arrest him
p01380_B,01380,B,very well so we will come along aziz old man nothing to fuss about some blunder
p01381_B,01381,B,oh for god s sake dear fellow we re coming to mcbryde together and enquire what s gone wrong he s a decent fellow it s all unintentional he ll apologize never never act the criminal
p01382_B,01382,B,hullo some mistake
p01383_B,01383,B,don t answer me like that produce your warrant
p01384_B,01384,B,i am under instructions not to say
p01385_B,01385,B,dr aziz will you kindly come a closed conveyance stands in readiness that will compel me to use force
p01386_B,01386,B,ah thank god he comes
p01387_B,01387,B,sir they are my instructions i know nothing
p01388_B,01388,B,sir excuse me no warrant is required under these particular circumstances refer to mr mcbryde

p01390_B,01390,B,may i conclude my statement
p01391_B,01391,B,i m excessively sorry sir i certainly withdraw it unconditionally
p01392_B,01392,B,oh no oh no no
p01393_B,01393,B,the news gave me a very great shock so i must ask you to forgive me i cannot believe that dr aziz is guilty
p01394_B,01394,B,i believe dr aziz to be innocent
p01395_B,01395,B,may i make a statement sir
p01396_B,01396,B,i am waiting for the verdict of the courts if he is guilty i resign from my service and leave india i resign from the club now
p01397_B,01397,B,then she s mad
p01398_B,01398,B,oh no no but not aziz not aziz absolutely impossible grotesque
p01399_B,01399,B,if i may venture to say so no i make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies but the charge they are bringing against aziz rests upon some mistake and five minutes will clear it up the man s manner is perfectly natural besides i know him to be incapable of infamy
p01400_B,01400,B,it is no good we all build upon sand and the more modern the country gets the worse ll be the crash in the old eighteenth century when cruelty and injustice raged an invisible power repaired their ravages everything echoes now there s no stopping the echo the original sound may be harmless but the echo is always evil
p01401_B,01401,B,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p01402_B,01402,B,oh no who lodges this infamous charge
p01403_B,01403,B,are you speaking to me officially sir
p01404_B,01404,B,i want to leave the room but cannot while this gentleman prevents me
p01405_B,01405,B,worse and worse appalling
p01406_B,01406,B,certainly
p01407_B,01407,B,pray mr fielding what induced you to speak to me in such a tone
p01408_B,01408,B,she escaped by god s grace
p01409_B,01409,B,that that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form
p01410_B,01410,B,you have a right to hold that opinion if you choose but pray is that any reason why you should insult mr heaslop
p01411_B,01411,B,certainly
p01412_B,01412,B,may i ask whether you have taken over charge of this district one moment mr fielding you are not to go yet please before you leave the club from which you do very well to resign you will express some detestation of the crime and you will apologize to mr heaslop
p01413_B,01413,B,i cannot pass that last remark you will withdraw it instantly it is the type of remark you have permitted yourself to make ever since you came to chandrapore
p01414_B,01414,B,i called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the police station
p01415_B,01415,B,it does indeed rest upon a mistake it does indeed i have had twenty five years experience of this country and during those twenty five years i have never known anything but disaster result when english people and indians attempt to be intimate socially intercourse yes courtesy by all means intimacy never never the whole weight of my authority is against it i have been in charge at chandrapore for six years and if everything has gone smoothly if there has been mutual respect and esteem it is because both peoples kept to this simple rule new comers set our traditions aside and in an instant what you see happens the work of years is undone and the good name of my district ruined for a generation i i can t see the end of this day s work mr fielding you who are imbued with modern ideas no doubt you can i wish i had never lived to see its beginning i know that it is the end of me that a lady that a young lady engaged to my most valued subordinate that she an english girl fresh from england that i should have lived i came down particularly on your account while poor heaslop got his mother away i regarded it as the most friendly thing i could do i meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at the club this evening to discuss the situation but i am doubtful whether you will care to come your visits there are always infrequent
p01416_B,01416,B,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p01417_B,01417,B,miss derek and the victim herself miss quested herself definitely accuses him of
p01418_B,01418,B,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p01419_B,01419,B,i had no idea that was in your mind
p01420_B,01420,B,wife indeed i know those wives
p01421_B,01421,B,i hardly think that would do surely
p01422_B,01422,B,city magistrate
p01423_B,01423,B,quite possible i m afraid when an indian goes bad he goes not only very bad but very queer
p01424_B,01424,B,yes one can t very well worry poor heaslop photographs of women ah
p01425_B,01425,B,it s no use ringing up them callendar settles a question like that of course you haven t grasped that she s seriously ill
p01426_B,01426,B,sort of all white thing the burra sahib would do we shall all have to hang together old man i m afraid i m your junior in years i know but very much your senior in service you don t happen to know this poisonous country as well as i do and you must take it from me that the general situation is going to be nasty at chandrapore during the next few weeks very nasty indeed
p01427_B,01427,B,you have never explained to me what s in your mind here why on earth do you want to see her
p01428_B,01428,B,but at a time like this there s no room for well personal views the man who doesn t toe the line is lost
p01429_B,01429,B,his own people seem in touch with him all right
p01430_B,01430,B,no she had got among some cactuses miss derek saved her life coming just then she was beginning to fling herself about she helped her down to the car miss quested couldn t stand the indian driver cried and it was that that put our friend on the track of what had happened they made straight for our bungalow and are there now that s the story as far as i know it yet she sent the driver to join you i think she behaved with great sense
p01431_B,01431,B,i couldn t worry her overmuch with questions she ll have plenty to go through in the witness box they don t bear thinking about these next weeks i wish the marabar hills and all they contain were at the bottom of the sea evening after evening one saw them from the club and they were just a harmless name yes we start already i heard some more from miss derek she is an old friend of us both and talks freely well her account is that you went off to locate the camp and almost at once she heard stones falling on the kawa dol and saw miss quested running straight down the face of a precipice well she climbed up a sort of gully to her and found her practically done for her helmet off
p01432_B,01432,B,no you don t see entirely he not only loses himself he weakens his friends if you leave the line you leave a gap in the line these jackals are looking with all their eyes for a gap
p01433_B,01433,B,a bit too finespun anyhow callendar won t hear of you seeing her i m sorry to say he gave a bad account just now he says that she is by no means out of danger i must put this report through now fielding
p01434_B,01434,B,what difference does that make
p01435_B,01435,B,innocence or guilt why mix yourself up what s the good
p01436_B,01436,B,how should you when you think of crime you think of english crime the psychology here is different i dare say you ll tell me next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to greet you no reason he should not be read any of the mutiny records which rather than the bhagavad gita should be your bible in this country though i m not sure that the one and the other are not closely connected am i not being beastly but you see fielding as i ve said to you once before you re a schoolmaster and consequently you come across these people at their best that s what puts you wrong they can be charming as boys but i know them as they really are after they have developed into men look at this for instance i am going through the contents they are not edifying here is a letter from a friend who apparently keeps a brothel
p01437_B,01437,B,well she tells her own story doesn t she
p01438_B,01438,B,no you may see him on a magistrate s order but on my own responsibility i don t feel justified it might lead to more complications
p01439_B,01439,B,that he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances she hit at him with her field glasses he pulled at them and the strap broke and that is how she got away when we searched him just now they were in his pocket
p01440_B,01440,B,have a look at them
p01441_B,01441,B,it ll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals he was fixing up to see women at calcutta
p01442_B,01442,B,i wouldn t keep you waiting good heavens you take precedence of any indian visitor of course i meant what s the good why mix yourself up with pitch
p01443_B,01443,B,how can i not
p01444_B,01444,B,she is in no state to see anyone besides you don t know her well
p01445_B,01445,B,how do you know that
p01446_B,01446,B,there was an echo that appears to have frightened her did you go into those caves
p01447_B,01447,B,possibly my wife might ask her that much
p01448_B,01448,B,those field glasses upset me for a minute but i ve thought since it s impossible that having attempted to assault her he would put her glasses into his pocket
p01449_B,01449,B,it s all a mistake
p01450_B,01450,B,i was afraid you ld say that i should very much like to
p01451_B,01451,B,that sounds comfortable
p01452_B,01452,B,i don t follow
p01453_B,01453,B,that s his wife
p01454_B,01454,B,he s sure to refuse it s all he exists for i only wanted to ask her whether she is certain dead certain that it was aziz who followed her into the cave
p01455_B,01455,B,so i have just told you
p01456_B,01456,B,on the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report and he s committed for trial and the whole thing goes to blazes old man don t argue about this but do of your goodness just ring up your wife or miss derek and enquire it ll cost you nothing
p01457_B,01457,B,i see what you mean
p01458_B,01458,B,well when he s done with them
p01459_B,01459,B,i suppose there s no possibility of my seeing miss quested
p01460_B,01460,B,was a guide not with her
p01461_B,01461,B,can i visit aziz
p01462_B,01462,B,i wish you wouldn t
p01463_B,01463,B,she is among people who disbelieve in indians
p01464_B,01464,B,oh good good one s got to breathe occasionally at least i have i mayn t see her and now i mayn t see him i promised him to come up here with him to you but turton called me off before i could get two steps
p01465_B,01465,B,i don t want to hear his private letters
p01466_B,01466,B,i know but she tells it to you
p01467_B,01467,B,to whom do i apply for an order
p01468_B,01468,B,oh no oh no no it ll be cleared up in five minutes
p01469_B,01469,B,did she say any more
p01470_B,01470,B,oh that ll do that ll do i dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for doing that but i haven t i did the same at his age miss quested really cannot be seen you do know that for a certainty
p01471_B,01471,B,i say he s innocent
p01472_B,01472,B,i feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous we are heading for a most awful smash i can see your prisoner i suppose
p01473_B,01473,B,hardly at all but you see i believe she s under some hideous delusion and that that wretched boy is innocent
p01474_B,01474,B,he told me
p01475_B,01475,B,i saw one of them there was an echo did it get on her nerves
p01476_B,01476,B,but i wanted to ask her i want someone who believes in him to ask her
p01477_B,01477,B,why don t one think more of other people
p01478_B,01478,B,then they ve started
p01479_B,01479,B,mr mcbryde s down there disguised as a holy man
p01480_B,01480,B,any more questions necessary questions
p01481_B,01481,B,that s exactly the sort of thing that must not be said mrs callendar be more careful than that please in these times
p01482_B,01482,B,i well i
p01483_B,01483,B,is the where is he
p01484_B,01484,B,jail bail has been refused i hope callendar may be able to let us know how things are going before long
p01485_B,01485,B,and a jolly suggestion the army s got to come in sooner or later a special train was in his mind inseparable from troops this would never have happened if barabas hill was under military control station a bunch of gurkhas at the entrance of the cave was all that was wanted
p01486_B,01486,B,english no good native troops for this country give me the sporting type of native give me gurkhas give me rajputs give me jats give me the punjabi give me sikhs give me marathas bhils afridis and pathans and really if it comes to that i don t mind if you give me the scums of the bazaars properly led mind i d lead them anywhere
p01487_B,01487,B,exactly what i said the native s all right if you get him alone lesley lesley you remember the one i had a knock with on your maidan last month well he was all right any native who plays polo is all right what you ve got to stamp on is these educated classes and mind i do know what i m talking about this time
p01488_B,01488,B,don t start carrying arms about i want everything to go on precisely as usual until there s cause for the contrary get the womenfolk off to the hills but do it quietly and for heaven s sake no more talk of special trains never mind what you think or feel possibly i have feelings too one isolated indian has attempted is charged with an attempted crime act upon that fact until there are more facts assume every indian is an angel
p01489_B,01489,B,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p01490_B,01490,B,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p01491_B,01491,B,how s the old lady
p01492_B,01492,B,sorry old man
p01493_B,01493,B,why should it
p01494_B,01494,B,squat down callendar tell us all about it
p01495_B,01495,B,my wife heard she was sinking
p01496_B,01496,B,does anyone here present want to
p01497_B,01497,B,temperature
p01498_B,01498,B,heaslop s just behind me
p01499_B,01499,B,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p01500_B,01500,B,take me some time to do that
p01501_B,01501,B,so she may be i guarantee nothing i really can t be plagued with questions lesley
p01502_B,01502,B,swine i should think so and what s more i ll tell you what what s happened is a damn good thing really barring of course its application to present company it ll make them squeal and it s time they did squeal i ve put the fear of god into them at the hospital anyhow you should see the grandson of our so called leading loyalist his beauty s gone five upper teeth two lower and a nostril old panna lal brought him the looking glass yesterday and he blubbered i laughed i laughed i tell you and so would you that used to be one of these buck niggers i thought now he s all septic damn him blast his soul er i believe he was unspeakably immoral er i wish i d had the cutting up of my late assistant too nothing s too bad for these people
p01503_B,01503,B,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p01504_B,01504,B,no what about him
p01505_B,01505,B,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p01506_B,01506,B,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p01507_B,01507,B,i don t feel that i wish i could responsibility is a very awful thing and i ve no use for the man who shirks it heard about miss quested s servant
p01508_B,01508,B,heaslop warned miss quested s servant last night never to lose sight of her prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him behind bribed him heaslop has just found out the whole story with names and sums a well known pimp to those people gave the money mohammed latif by name so much for the servant what about the englishman our friend here how did they get rid of him money again oh i m being misunderstood apologies i didn t mean they bribed mr fielding
p01509_B,01509,B,i do i do i m satisfied
p01510_B,01510,B,that s ridiculous
p01511_B,01511,B,then what do you mean
p01512_B,01512,B,heaslop also found out something from his mother aziz paid a herd of natives to suffocate her in a cave that was the end of her or would have been only she got out nicely planned wasn t it neat then he could go on with the girl he and she and a guide provided by the same mohammed latif guide now can t be found pretty it s not the time for sitting down it s the time for action call in the troops and clear the bazaars i suppose nothing that s said inside the club will go outside the club
p01513_B,01513,B,they paid the other indian to make you late godbole he was saying his prayers i know those prayers
p01514_B,01514,B,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p01515_B,01515,B,how is your mother old boy
p01516_B,01516,B,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p01517_B,01517,B,you are sure to know best i have no experience burra sahib
p01518_B,01518,B,better thank you i wish everyone would sit down
p01519_B,01519,B,i thought they d try something of the sort ingenious they get just like over their religion start and can t stop i m sorry for your old das he s not getting much of a show
p01520_B,01520,B,some have never got up
p01521_B,01521,B,das is really
p01522_B,01522,B,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p01523_B,01523,B,not one of them s all right
p01524_B,01524,B,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p01525_B,01525,B,stand up you swine
p01526_B,01526,B,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p01527_B,01527,B,that s your way of putting it but a man can be a crank without being a cad miss quested had better know how he behaved to you if you don t tell her somebody else will he is now the mainstay of the defence i needn t add he is the one righteous englishman in a horde of tyrants he receives deputations from the bazaar and they all chew betel nut and smear one another s hands with scent it is not easy to enter into the mind of such a man his students are on strike out of enthusiasm for him they won t learn their lessons if it weren t for fielding one would never have had the mohurram trouble he has done a very grave disservice to the whole community the letter lay here a day or two waiting till you were well enough then the situation got so grave that i decided to open it in case it was useful to us
p01528_B,01528,B,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p01529_B,01529,B,that is quite correct
p01530_B,01530,B,i cannot be sure
p01531_B,01531,B,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p01532_B,01532,B,i must come before someone
p01533_B,01533,B,the most wonderfully shaped of those hills yes no one else was present to my knowledge we appeared to be alone
p01534_B,01534,B,i am not i am not quite sure
p01535_B,01535,B,may i have half a minute before i reply to that mr mcbryde
p01536_B,01536,B,no
p01537_B,01537,B,is it
p01538_B,01538,B,i do this less every day i shall soon be quite well what i need is something to do that is why i keep on with this ridiculous crying
p01539_B,01539,B,i know where you mean
p01540_B,01540,B,i m afraid i have made a mistake
p01541_B,01541,B,why should he write to me
p01542_B,01542,B,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p01543_B,01543,B,certainly
p01544_B,01544,B,what is that what are you saying speak up please
p01545_B,01545,B,very well there is a ledge half way up the hill or broken ground rather with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah
p01546_B,01546,B,that s that s the way to face it you have the pluck miss quested the fruits of democracy
p01547_B,01547,B,you went alone into one of those caves
p01548_B,01548,B,i didn t catch that answer you are on that landing or whatever we term it and you have entered a cave i suggest to you that the prisoner followed you what do you mean please
p01549_B,01549,B,i beg your pardon
p01550_B,01550,B,what nature of mistake
p01551_B,01551,B,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p01552_B,01552,B,it s not ridiculous we think you wonderful it only bothers us that we can t help you more your stopping here at such a time is the greatest honour this house by the way a letter came here for you while you were ill i opened it which is a strange confession to make will you forgive me the circumstances are peculiar it is from fielding
p01553_B,01553,B,and the prisoner followed you
p01554_B,01554,B,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p01555_B,01555,B,a most lamentable thing has happened the defence got hold of him
p01556_B,01556,B,he s a crank a crank
p01557_B,01557,B,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p01558_B,01558,B,in fact you disapprove of the appeal i forwarded to lady mellanby pray don t apologize mr heaslop i am accustomed to being in the wrong
p01559_B,01559,B,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p01560_B,01560,B,exactly and remember it afterwards you men you re weak weak weak why they ought to crawl from here to the caves on their hands and knees whenever an englishwoman s in sight they oughtn t to be spoken to they ought to be spat at they ought to be ground into the dust we ve been far too kind with our bridge parties and the rest weak weak
p01561_B,01561,B,at last some sense is being talked
p01562_B,01562,B,thoroughly desirable change for several reasons right mcbryde go ahead now sorry to have interrupted you
p01563_B,01563,B,that s what i say i say there s not such a thing as cruelty after a thing like this
p01564_B,01564,B,turn that man out
p01565_B,01565,B,do you feel faint adela
p01566_B,01566,B,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p01567_B,01567,B,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p01568_B,01568,B,you withdraw the charge answer me
p01569_B,01569,B,that s better
p01570_B,01570,B,are you all right yourselves
p01571_B,01571,B,now we ve got im
p01572_B,01572,B,we shall do we shall do
p01573_B,01573,B,oh cut the cackle and let s have the verdict
p01574_B,01574,B,well done das quite sound
p01575_B,01575,B,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p01576_B,01576,B,i should object a platform confers authority
p01577_B,01577,B,even when it s one foot high so come along all
p01578_B,01578,B,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p01579_B,01579,B,are you mad
p01580_B,01580,B,give me time to consider
p01581_B,01581,B,prisoner s dupes
p01582_B,01582,B,the prisoner and the guide took you on to the kawa dol no one else being present
p01583_B,01583,B,in which cave is the offence alleged the buddhist or the jain
p01584_B,01584,B,yes sir then in which jain cave
p01585_B,01585,B,you don t because you can t you have smuggled her out of the country she is mrs moore she would have proved his innocence she was on our side she was poor indians friend
p01586_B,01586,B,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p01587_B,01587,B,all the marabar caves are jain
p01588_B,01588,B,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p01589_B,01589,B,this is no way to defend your case
p01590_B,01590,B,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p01591_B,01591,B,she was kept from us until too late i learn too late this is english justice here is your british raj give us back mrs moore for five minutes only and she will save my friend she will save the name of his sons don t rule her out mr das take back those words as you yourself are a father tell me where they have put her oh mrs moore
p01592_B,01592,B,i am not defending a case nor are you trying one we are both of us slaves
p01593_B,01593,B,do so this trial is a farce i am going aziz aziz farewell for ever
p01594_B,01594,B,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p01595_B,01595,B,imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth i ruin my career no matter we are all to be ruined one by one
p01596_B,01596,B,unexpected
p01597_B,01597,B,ronny
p01598_B,01598,B,mr mahmoud ali will have to apologize in person
p01599_B,01599,B,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p01600_B,01600,B,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p01601_B,01601,B,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p01602_B,01602,B,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p01603_B,01603,B,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p01604_B,01604,B,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p01605_B,01605,B,i withdraw everything
p01606_B,01606,B,dr aziz never
p01607_B,01607,B,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p01608_B,01608,B,enough sit down mr mcbryde do you wish to continue in the face of this
p01609_B,01609,B,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p01610_B,01610,B,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p01611_B,01611,B,right i withdraw
p01612_B,01612,B,what do you want here where are you going miss quested
p01613_B,01613,B,i don t want the rubbish get out
p01614_B,01614,B,no sir this is an honour for us
p01615_B,01615,B,sir i am a horse we shall be your horses
p01616_B,01616,B,cyril again you desert
p01617_B,01617,B,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p01618_B,01618,B,quite so i have given trouble enough
p01619_B,01619,B,will you ask him what he wants mr fielding
p01620_B,01620,B,perfectly right
p01621_B,01621,B,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p01622_B,01622,B,at last
p01623_B,01623,B,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p01624_B,01624,B,all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves
p01625_B,01625,B,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p01626_B,01626,B,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p01627_B,01627,B,it is clearly to be understood sir that neither mr fielding nor any of us are responsible for this lady s safety at government college
p01628_B,01628,B,he comes he comes he comes i cringe i tremble
p01629_B,01629,B,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him
p01630_B,01630,B,he wants you of course
p01631_B,01631,B,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p01632_B,01632,B,aden
p01633_B,01633,B,ah you were boasting she had reached aden in court
p01634_B,01634,B,twenty thousand rupees

p01638_B,01638,B,happy the man who can compose both
p01639_B,01639,B,i know you bear me a grudge for trying that case you are so kind and friendly but always i detect irony beneath your manner
p01640_B,01640,B,it is not for hindus but indians generally
p01641_B,01641,B,i fear not and for that reason if i may say so do not introduce too many persian expressions into the poem and not too much about the bulbul
p01642_B,01642,B,professor godbole often mentioned it before his departure for mau
p01643_B,01643,B,he too was a poet do you not divine each other
p01644_B,01644,B,there is no such person in existence as the general indian
