247,Harriet,"['Mr. Herriton', 'Mrs. Herriton']",after all she has suffered that letter kept me awake for nights the whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right but if we have mourning it will mean telling irma,287,287,Q287
248,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",of course we must tell irma,288,288,Q288
249,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage,289,289,Q289
250,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now,290,290,Q290
251,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her,291,291,Q291
252,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby,292,292,Q292

256,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",i must say it seems rather hard luck doesn t it,296,296,Q296
257,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",on irma why,297,297,Q297
258,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them,298,298,Q298
259,Harriet,"['Mr. Herriton', 'Mrs. Herriton']",there s no need to twist the thing round to that,299,299,Q299
260,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours,300,300,Q300
261,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",it will make a difference in the money surely,301,301,Q301

264,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",he will get all hers but you know what that is,304,304,Q304
265,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott,305,305,Q305
266,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline,306,306,Q306
267,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",she was so mixed up in the affair,307,307,Q307
268,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them,308,308,Q308
269,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off,309,309,Q309
270,Mrs. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mr. Herriton']",yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men,310,310,Q310
271,Mr. Herriton,"['Harriet', 'Mrs. Herriton']",that is quite true,311,311,Q311
272,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed,312,312,Q312
273,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean,313,313,Q313
274,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],she did but she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy she saw that i was reticent and she did not press me you see philip i can say to you what i could not say before harriet her ideas are so crude really we do not want it known in sawston that there is a baby all peace and comfort would be lost if people came inquiring after it,314,314,Q314
275,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],it is all so strange as well as so tragic and what i did was as strange as anything,315,315,Q315
276,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],never mind it s all over now let the dead bury their dead it s fallen out of our lives,316,316,Q316
277,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame,317,317,Q317
278,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],indeed i never think about it now,318,318,Q318
279,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],the first evening we got to monteriano lilia went out for a walk alone saw that italian in a picturesque position on a wall and fell in love he was shabbily dressed and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist i must tell you i was used to this sort of thing once or twice before i had had to send people about their business,319,319,Q319
280,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],yes we counted on you,320,320,Q320
281,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy,321,321,Q321
282,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],really really you knew lilia all your life apart from everything else as if she could choose what could make her happy,322,322,Q322
283,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude,323,324,"Q323,Q324"
284,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],let us rather say unhappily expressed,325,325,Q325
285,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all,326,326,Q326
286,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],and the telegram,327,327,Q327
287,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],ah the telegram that was wrong lilia there was more cowardly than i was we should have told the truth it lost me my nerve at all events i came to the station meaning to tell you everything then but we had started with a lie and i got frightened and at the end when you left i got frightened again and came with you,328,328,Q328
288,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],did you really mean to stop,329,329,Q329
289,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],for a time at all events,330,330,Q330
290,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],would that have suited a newly married pair,331,331,Q331
291,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],it would have suited them lilia needed me and as for him i can t help feeling i might have got influence over him,332,332,Q332
292,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],i am ignorant of these matters but i should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation,333,333,Q333
293,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],well i have explained,334,334,Q334
294,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],but pardon me miss abbott of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation,335,335,Q335
295,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],an explanation may bore you mr herriton it drags in other topics,336,336,Q336
296,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],oh never mind,337,337,Q337
297,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],i hated sawston you see,338,338,Q338
298,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],so did and do i that s splendid go on,339,339,Q339
299,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness,340,340,Q340
300,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],petty selfishness,341,341,Q341
301,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano,342,342,Q342
302,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],why miss abbott you should have told me this before think it still i agree with lots of it magnificent,343,343,Q343
303,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now,344,344,Q344

308,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],oh i quite sympathize with what you say it isn t nonsense and a year or two ago i should have been saying it too but i feel differently now and i hope that you also will change society is invincible to a certain degree but your real life is your own and nothing can touch it there is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life the real you,349,349,Q349
309,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],i have never had that experience yet surely i and my life must be where i live,350,350,Q350

333,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],hopeful indeed,375,375,Q375

353,Mrs. Herriton,"['Caroline Abbott', 'Mr. Herriton']",my dear caroline you must not brood over the thing let bygones be bygones the child should worry you even less than it worries us we never even mention it it belongs to another world,396,396,Q396
354,Caroline Abbott,"['Mr. Herriton', 'Mrs. Herriton']",of course if mrs theobald decides on any plan that seems at all practicable i must say i don t see any such i shall ask if i may join her in it for irma s sake and share in any possible expenses please would you let me know if she decides on anything i should like to join as well,397,398,"Q397,Q398"

358,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities,404,405,"Q404,Q405"
359,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to,406,406,Q406
360,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain,407,407,Q407
361,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott,408,408,Q408
362,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it,409,409,Q409
363,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],you talk like harriet,410,410,Q410

365,Mrs. Herriton,['_unknowable'],i am planning what can be done and that kind caroline abbott is helping me it is no business of either of us but we are getting to feel that the baby must not be left entirely to that horrible man it would be unfair to little irma after all he is her half brother no we have come to nothing definite,412,412,Q412
366,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],what do you think of it it would not do to let him know that we are anxious for it,413,413,Q413
367,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],certainly he will never suppose that,414,414,Q414
368,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],but what effect will the letter have on him,415,415,Q415
369,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father,416,416,Q416
370,Mrs. Herriton,['Mr. Herriton'],dear you re shockingly cynical how would the sum work out,417,418,"Q417,Q418"
371,Mr. Herriton,['Mrs. Herriton'],i don t know i m sure but if you wanted to ensure the baby being posted by return you should have sent a little sum to him oh i m not cynical at least i only go by what i know of him but i am weary of the whole show weary of italy weary weary weary sawston s a kind pitiful place isn t it i will go walk in it and seek comfort,419,419,Q419

487,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],i suppose i misunderstood perfetta where did you have your interview then,553,553,Q553
488,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],not an interview an accident i am very sorry i meant you to have the chance of seeing him first though it is your fault you are a day late you were due here yesterday so i came yesterday and not finding you went up to the rocca you know that kitchen garden where they let you in and there is a ladder up to a broken tower where you can stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the other hills,554,554,Q554

495,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],my dear miss abbott he is not a murderer i have just been driving that into harriet and when you know the italians as well as i do you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere the italians are essentially dramatic they look on death and love as spectacles i don t doubt that he persuaded himself for the moment that he had behaved admirably both as husband and widower,561,561,Q561
496,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],you may be right when i tried to pave the way so to speak to hint that he had not behaved as he ought well it was no good at all he couldn t or wouldn t understand,562,562,Q562

698,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],why yes since we talk openly that is all i am after just now what else is there if i can persuade signor carella to give in so much the better if he won t i must report the failure to my mother and then go home why miss abbott you can t expect me to follow you through all these turns,793,793,Q793
699,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all,794,794,Q794
700,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],because i understand the position of signor carella and of you it s no reason that,795,795,Q795
701,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair,796,796,Q796

718,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],perhaps i ought but it isn t a very big ought whatever harriet and i do the issue is the same why i can see the splendour of it even the humour gino sitting up here on the mountain top with his cub we come and ask for it he welcomes us we ask for it again he is equally pleasant i m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him but i know that at the end of it i shall descend empty handed to the plains it might be finer of me to make up my mind but i m not a fine character and nothing hangs on it,816,816,Q816
719,Caroline Abbott,['Mr. Herriton'],perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever,817,817,Q817

867,Mr. Herriton,['Caroline Abbott'],but through my fault he is parted from the child he loves and because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke to him again,996,996,Q996
