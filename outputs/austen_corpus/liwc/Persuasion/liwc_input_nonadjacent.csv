p00000_A,00000,A,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying
p00001_A,00001,A,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p00002_A,00002,A,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier
p00003_A,00003,A,very true very true what miss anne says is very true
p00004_A,00004,A,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p00005_A,00005,A,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p00006_A,00006,A,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery
p00007_A,00007,A,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p00008_A,00008,A,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p00009_A,00009,A,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure
p00010_A,00010,A,i cannot possibly do without anne
p00011_A,00011,A,i think very differently an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me
p00012_A,00012,A,and i will tell you our reason and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things
p00013_A,00013,A,nothing can be going on better than the child so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter
p00014_A,00014,A,well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him
p00015_A,00015,A,this is very kind of anne and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child
p00016_A,00016,A,i felt my luck admiral i assure you i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something
p00017_A,00017,A,to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again
p00018_A,00018,A,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p00019_A,00019,A,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p00020_A,00020,A,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p00021_A,00021,A,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p00022_A,00022,A,and i am sure sir it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did poor dear fellow he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you
p00023_A,00023,A,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p00024_A,00024,A,my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth
p00025_A,00025,A,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p00026_A,00026,A,ay that we shall
p00027_A,00027,A,when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it
p00028_A,00028,A,what a great traveller you must have been ma am
p00029_A,00029,A,pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies
p00030_A,00030,A,aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again
p00031_A,00031,A,i hope the little boy is better
p00032_A,00032,A,how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently
p00033_A,00033,A,ah you make the most of it i know but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
p00034_A,00034,A,had you i honour you
p00035_A,00035,A,bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired
p00036_A,00036,A,no no
p00037_A,00037,A,oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good
p00038_A,00038,A,it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life
p00039_A,00039,A,pray can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away
p00040_A,00040,A,no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day
p00041_A,00041,A,of course you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him
p00042_A,00042,A,i am determined i will
p00043_A,00043,A,she is dead she is dead
p00044_A,00044,A,true true a surgeon this instant
p00045_A,00045,A,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p00046_A,00046,A,had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
p00047_A,00047,A,i have been considering what we had best do she must not appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove do you think this is a good plan
p00048_A,00048,A,no i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end of miss elliot s charms
p00049_A,00049,A,and i am sure it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me
p00050_A,00050,A,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p00051_A,00051,A,well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick
p00052_A,00052,A,you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him
p00053_A,00053,A,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p00054_A,00054,A,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p00055_A,00055,A,you will not like him i will answer for it
p00056_A,00056,A,he is a man whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me
p00057_A,00057,A,if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse
p00058_A,00058,A,the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view
p00059_A,00059,A,elizabeth very well time will explain
p00060_A,00060,A,it was an acquaintance worth having
p00061_A,00061,A,i love your indignation it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him
p00062_A,00062,A,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now
p00063_A,00063,A,westgate buildings and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction that she is old and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty
p00064_A,00064,A,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p00065_A,00065,A,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name
p00066_A,00066,A,what is this the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due to my tenant
p00067_A,00067,A,how is mary and pray what brings the crofts to bath
p00068_A,00068,A,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p00069_A,00069,A,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p00070_A,00070,A,have they any acquaintance here
p00071_A,00071,A,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p00072_A,00072,A,oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them
p00073_A,00073,A,you will wonder what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night they described the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description
p00074_A,00074,A,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust
p00075_A,00075,A,a very fine young man indeed more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say
p00076_A,00076,A,my dear miss elliot
p00077_A,00077,A,and mine kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately
p00078_A,00078,A,to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in my father s great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since
p00079_A,00079,A,do come anne come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme
p00080_A,00080,A,yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend
p00081_A,00081,A,but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family
p00082_A,00082,A,don t talk to me about heirs and representatives i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me
p00083_A,00083,A,we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials
p00084_A,00084,A,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this
p00085_A,00085,A,not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes
p00086_A,00086,A,you are a good soul there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied
p00087_A,00087,A,here frederick you and i part company i believe i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party we had your sister s card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves
p00088_A,00088,A,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p00089_A,00089,A,good morning god bless you
p00090_A,00090,A,do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me
p00091_A,00091,A,are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop
p00000_B,00000,B,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p00001_B,00001,B,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him
p00002_B,00002,B,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
p00003_B,00003,B,the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it
p00004_B,00004,B,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p00005_B,00005,B,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother
p00006_B,00006,B,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p00007_B,00007,B,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p00008_B,00008,B,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common
p00009_B,00009,B,a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here
p00010_B,00010,B,mrs clay never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her s and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles
p00011_B,00011,B,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
p00012_B,00012,B,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen
p00013_B,00013,B,but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so
p00014_B,00014,B,i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday
p00015_B,00015,B,captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again
p00016_B,00016,B,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p00017_B,00017,B,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p00018_B,00018,B,and so then i suppose so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot
p00019_B,00019,B,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p00020_B,00020,B,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p00021_B,00021,B,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p00022_B,00022,B,should i i am glad i was not a week later then but if i know myself this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it
p00023_B,00023,B,oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether
p00024_B,00024,B,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p00025_B,00025,B,now i have done
p00026_B,00026,B,when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it
p00027_B,00027,B,pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies
p00028_B,00028,B,and i do assure you ma am that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience
p00029_B,00029,B,aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again
p00030_B,00030,B,upon my word it would dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet lady wentworth sounds very well that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that sir frederick and lady wentworth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations you know i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them and pray who is charles hayter nothing but a country curate a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross
p00031_B,00031,B,walter get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you
p00032_B,00032,B,walter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt
p00033_B,00033,B,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p00034_B,00034,B,bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired
p00035_B,00035,B,no no
p00036_B,00036,B,it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life
p00037_B,00037,B,and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance
p00038_B,00038,B,she would have turned back then but for you
p00039_B,00039,B,bless me it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family
p00040_B,00040,B,putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin
p00041_B,00041,B,no that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand
p00042_B,00042,B,is there no one to help me
p00043_B,00043,B,go to him go to him for heaven s sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them
p00044_B,00044,B,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p00045_B,00045,B,yes yes to the inn i will carry her myself musgrove take care of the others
p00046_B,00046,B,thank god
p00047_B,00047,B,i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it
p00048_B,00048,B,i must see captain benwick before i decide
p00049_B,00049,B,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p00050_B,00050,B,oh as to being anne s acquaintance i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
p00051_B,00051,B,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p00052_B,00052,B,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p00053_B,00053,B,yes that he will he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that
p00054_B,00054,B,upon my word i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand
p00055_B,00055,B,i hope i shall remember in future not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays
p00056_B,00056,B,oh when shall i leave you again
p00057_B,00057,B,that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you
p00058_B,00058,B,my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification
p00059_B,00059,B,my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company
p00060_B,00060,B,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for
p00061_B,00061,B,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
p00062_B,00062,B,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged
p00063_B,00063,B,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p00064_B,00064,B,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name
p00065_B,00065,B,mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him but we should not suit
p00066_B,00066,B,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p00067_B,00067,B,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p00068_B,00068,B,have they any acquaintance here
p00069_B,00069,B,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p00070_B,00070,B,i suspect that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place
p00071_B,00071,B,oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them
p00072_B,00072,B,none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home
p00073_B,00073,B,how do you do
p00074_B,00074,B,this is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar
p00075_B,00075,B,is not this song worth staying for
p00076_B,00076,B,very well i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrang in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course
p00077_B,00077,B,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both
p00078_B,00078,B,no it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow
p00079_B,00079,B,well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother
p00080_B,00080,B,good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful
p00081_B,00081,B,we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us
p00082_B,00082,B,if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps
p00083_B,00083,B,that is precisely what i was going to observe i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual
p00084_B,00084,B,have you finished your letter
p00085_B,00085,B,perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything
p00086_B,00086,B,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p00087_B,00087,B,good morning god bless you
p00088_B,00088,B,by all means my dear go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk
p00089_B,00089,B,i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both
p00090_B,00090,B,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town
p00091_B,00091,B,you should have distinguished you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated
