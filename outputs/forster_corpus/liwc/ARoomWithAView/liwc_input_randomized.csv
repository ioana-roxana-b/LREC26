p00000_A,00000,A,the signora had no business to do it no business at all she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart oh lucy
p00001_A,00001,A,this meat has surely been used for soup
p00002_A,00002,A,any nook does for me but it does seem hard that you shouldn t have a view
p00003_A,00003,A,you must have it
p00004_A,00004,A,i insist on it your mother would never forgive me lucy
p00005_A,00005,A,because it is quite out of the question thank you
p00006_A,00006,A,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p00007_A,00007,A,how do you do mr beebe i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peter s that very cold easter
p00008_A,00008,A,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p00009_A,00009,A,was i a bore why didn t you talk lucy he prefers young people i m sure i do hope i haven t monopolized him i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinner time
p00010_A,00010,A,my dear lucia
p00011_A,00011,A,funny girl how you do remind me of your mother i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe
p00012_A,00012,A,i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion
p00013_A,00013,A,undoubtedly he was
p00014_A,00014,A,beautiful are not beauty and delicacy the same
p00015_A,00015,A,poor young man
p00016_A,00016,A,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p00017_A,00017,A,naturally dear it is my affair
p00018_A,00018,A,no dear i want to explain why it is that i have taken the largest room naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this
p00019_A,00019,A,because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too
p00020_A,00020,A,far worse mr eager does not like eleanor she knows it herself the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him where things might lead to whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr eager or mr eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogether which they could scarcely do but in any case we must be prepared it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind a one horse carriage would do for us yet how difficult it is
p00021_A,00021,A,what do you think about it
p00022_A,00022,A,oh dear lucy i do hope florence isn t boring you speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow
p00023_A,00023,A,and the news
p00024_A,00024,A,oh not that way back we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria
p00025_A,00025,A,i die for it
p00026_A,00026,A,oh lucy you ought to be with mr eager i m sure
p00027_A,00027,A,mr eager will be offended it is your party
p00028_A,00028,A,lucy without a moment s doubt lucy the ground will do for me really i have not had rheumatism for years if i do feel it coming on i shall stand imagine your mother s feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen here we are all settled delightfully even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown sit down dear you are too unselfish you don t assert yourself enough now don t be alarmed this isn t a cold it s the tiniest cough and i have had it three days it s nothing to do with sitting here at all
p00029_A,00029,A,do not cry dearest take your time
p00030_A,00030,A,i trust not one would always pray against that
p00031_A,00031,A,in a book
p00032_A,00032,A,and then
p00033_A,00033,A,don t be troubled dearest wait till you are calmer we will talk it over before bed time in my room
p00034_A,00034,A,well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair so what is to be done what is to be done a point dearest which you alone can settle
p00035_A,00035,A,how do you propose to silence him
p00036_A,00036,A,my dear girl no mr george emerson
p00037_A,00037,A,how are you going to stop him talking about it
p00038_A,00038,A,my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first come here and listen to me i am only gathering it from his own remarks do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another well i am no prude there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish but we are no farther on with our question what do you propose to do
p00039_A,00039,A,and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence
p00040_A,00040,A,but we fear him for you dear you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can be how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened
p00041_A,00041,A,what would have happened if i hadn t arrived
p00042_A,00042,A,when he insulted you how would you have replied
p00043_A,00043,A,yes but won t you tell me now what you would have done
p00044_A,00044,A,come away from the window dear you will be seen from the road oh for a real man we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless there is mr eager but you do not trust him oh for your brother he is young but i know that his sister s insult would rouse in him a very lion thank god chivalry is not yet dead there are still left some men who can reverence woman it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try
p00045_A,00045,A,the train to rome
p00046_A,00046,A,at eight
p00047_A,00047,A,we must face that
p00048_A,00048,A,i expect she will however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel isn t afternoon tea given there for nothing
p00049_A,00049,A,dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me
p00050_A,00050,A,you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too i know well how much i vex you at every turn
p00051_A,00051,A,my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary you had your own way about these rooms at all events
p00052_A,00052,A,i have been a failure failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster
p00053_A,00053,A,it is my fault it is a disaster she will never forgive me and rightly for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish
p00054_A,00054,A,when i was here for your sake if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her
p00055_A,00055,A,but you tell her everything
p00056_A,00056,A,i dare not break your confidence there is something sacred in it unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her
p00057_A,00057,A,but who am i to give the sovereign to
p00058_A,00058,A,i had forgotten the driver thank you dear for reminding me a shilling was it can any one give me change for half a crown
p00059_A,00059,A,have you told him about him yet
p00060_A,00060,A,how dreadful how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source
p00061_A,00061,A,for instance the driver i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth
p00062_A,00062,A,we must think of every possibility
p00063_A,00063,A,or perhaps old mr emerson knows in fact he is certain to know
p00064_A,00064,A,to contradict it
p00065_A,00065,A,very well dear you know best perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young ladies are certainly different
p00066_A,00066,A,i am no match for you in conversation dearest i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am you will never forgive me
p00067_A,00067,A,dear one moment we may not have this chance for a chat again have you seen the young one yet
p00068_A,00068,A,what happened
p00069_A,00069,A,what line is he taking up
p00070_A,00070,A,once a cad always a cad that is my poor opinion
p00071_A,00071,A,once a cad always a cad
p00072_A,00072,A,my good lucia i am all at sea i know nothing about it whatever

p00077_A,00077,A,i will never forgive eleanor she has betrayed my confidence
p00078_A,00078,A,oh lucy i shall never forgive myself never to my dying day fancy if your prospects
p00079_A,00079,A,i always said he was a cad dear give me credit for that at all events from the very first moment when he said his father was having a bath
p00080_A,00080,A,willingly would i move heaven and earth
p00081_A,00081,A,never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00082_A,00082,A,it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle
p00083_A,00083,A,oh lucy but that is brave of you i admire you
p00084_A,00084,A,lucy do you mind doing it

p00087_A,00087,A,lucy dearest
p00088_A,00088,A,and a cockney besides it might be london charlotte don t you feel too that we might be in london i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside i suppose it is one s being so tired
p00089_A,00089,A,i want so to see the arno the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno the signora had no business to do it at all oh it is a shame
p00090_A,00090,A,charlotte you mustn t spoil me of course you must look over the arno too i meant that the first vacant room in the front
p00091_A,00091,A,no no you must have it

p00095_A,00095,A,he is nice just what i remember he seems to see good in everyone no one would take him for a clergyman
p00096_A,00096,A,well you know what i mean and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man
p00097_A,00097,A,i m sure she will and so will freddy

p00099_A,00099,A,mr beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature of course i was holding back on my cousin s account about old mr emerson i hardly know no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same time beautiful

p00148_A,00148,A,we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren t careful how could a florentine cab driver ever get hold of cecil
p00149_A,00149,A,oh it s all right
p00150_A,00150,A,i don t care if he does i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it

p00155_A,00155,A,we met at the rectory
p00156_A,00156,A,no line he talked about italy like any other person it is really all right what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly i do wish i could make you see it my way he really won t be any nuisance charlotte
p00157_A,00157,A,cecil said one day and i thought it so profound that there are two kinds of cads the conscious and the subconscious
p00158_A,00158,A,oh i had no idea
p00159_A,00159,A,do you know about it please they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance
p00160_A,00160,A,there are violets i cannot believe it is a coincidence charlotte charlotte how could you have told her i have thought before speaking it must be you
p00161_A,00161,A,about that dreadful afternoon in february
p00162_A,00162,A,not so that one could recognize it yes
p00163_A,00163,A,so you did tell
p00164_A,00164,A,but charlotte what about the promise you gave me when we were packing why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldn t even let me tell mother
p00165_A,00165,A,why did you tell her though this is a most serious thing cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again behind cecil s back ugh is it possible that men are such brutes behind cecil s back as we were walking up the garden what is to be done now can you tell me
p00166_A,00166,A,i know i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable however what s done s done you have put me in a most awkward position how am i to get out of it he must that man must have such a setting down that he won t forget and who s to give it him i can t tell mother now owing to you nor cecil charlotte owing to you i am caught up every way i think i shall go mad i have no one to help me that s why i ve sent for you what s wanted is a man with a whip yes but it s no good agreeing what s to be done we women go maundering on what does a girl do when she comes across a cad
p00167_A,00167,A,oh bother the credit and who s been right or wrong we ve both made a muddle of it george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isn t he i want to know you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome can t you speak again to him now
p00168_A,00168,A,i want something more definite will you speak to him it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word

p00170_A,00170,A,freddy has taken him into the dining room the others are going down the garden come let us get this over quickly come i want you in the room of course
p00171_A,00171,A,how can you ask such a ridiculous question
p00172_A,00172,A,well he amuses me either i m mad or else he is and i m inclined to think it s the latter one more fuss through with you charlotte many thanks i think though that this is the last my admirer will hardly trouble me again
p00173_A,00173,A,i have a view i have a view
p00174_A,00174,A,what i mean is that you can have our rooms and we ll have yours we ll change

p00212_A,00212,A,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p00213_A,00213,A,why shouldn t you
p00214_A,00214,A,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p00215_A,00215,A,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p00216_A,00216,A,you will never go up you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives
p00217_A,00217,A,george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate
p00218_A,00218,A,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p00219_A,00219,A,so george says he says that the miss alans must go to the wall yet it does seem so unkind
p00220_A,00220,A,yes indeed
p00221_A,00221,A,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p00222_A,00222,A,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p00223_A,00223,A,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p00224_A,00224,A,yes i heard from mother so last week she didn t know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr beebe is
p00225_A,00225,A,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p00226_A,00226,A,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p00227_A,00227,A,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p00228_A,00228,A,oh what a funny thing some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet
p00229_A,00229,A,she doesn t mind it but she doesn t like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it she thinks i can t make out once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any one s she has never got over it of course i didn t mean that i played well i only meant
p00230_A,00230,A,poor charlotte will be sopped
p00231_A,00231,A,miss lavish is so original is it true that miss lavish is writing a book
p00232_A,00232,A,what is it about
p00233_A,00233,A,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish
p00234_A,00234,A,whatever happened
p00235_A,00235,A,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p00236_A,00236,A,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p00237_A,00237,A,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p00238_A,00238,A,oh it has been such a nuisance first he then they no one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome
p00239_A,00239,A,but cecil s emersons they can t possibly be the same ones there is that
p00240_A,00240,A,he seems in better spirits he laughs more
p00241_A,00241,A,i don t think i will thank you
p00242_A,00242,A,oh he did
p00243_A,00243,A,mother charlotte cecil freddy you
p00244_A,00244,A,so i hoped other people would think but they don t seem to
p00245_A,00245,A,so does mother mother minds dreadfully
p00246_A,00246,A,and freddy minds
p00247_A,00247,A,boys are so odd
p00248_A,00248,A,how delightful going abroad when do they start
p00249_A,00249,A,did freddy say whether he was driving straight back
p00250_A,00250,A,because i do hope he won t go gossiping oh do tell me more about the miss alans how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad
p00251_A,00251,A,oh delightful i wish they d take me
p00252_A,00252,A,oh not italy but constantinople i have always longed to go to constantinople constantinople is practically asia isn t it
p00253_A,00253,A,oh that s nothing i assure you cissie villa s nothing to me i would give anything to go with them
p00254_A,00254,A,she must spare me i simply must go away i have to don t you see that i have to go away i didn t realize at the time and of course i want to see constantinople so particularly
p00255_A,00255,A,yes yes i knew you d understand yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down
p00256_A,00256,A,no not at all cecil was very kind indeed only i had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a little it was that he is so masterful i found that he wouldn t let me go my own way he would improve me in places where i can t be improved cecil won t let a woman decide for herself in fact he daren t what nonsense i do talk but that is the kind of thing
p00257_A,00257,A,i must get away ever so far i must know my own mind and where i want to go
p00258_A,00258,A,mr beebe knows my rude ways
p00259_A,00259,A,it isn t very good i forget why harmony or something
p00260_A,00260,A,i think so i ll see
p00261_A,00261,A,very well thank you
p00262_A,00262,A,i i did
p00263_A,00263,A,i shall never marry him
p00264_A,00264,A,mr beebe i have misled you i have misled myself
p00265_A,00265,A,mr beebe could you help me
p00266_A,00266,A,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p00267_A,00267,A,he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth
p00268_A,00268,A,miss bartlett it s all right about the rooms i m so glad mr emerson was talking about it in the smoking room and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again he has let me come and ask you he would be so pleased
p00269_A,00269,A,doesn t mrs honeychurch like music
p00270_A,00270,A,what about music
p00271_A,00271,A,miss lavish has led your cousin astray she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe
p00272_A,00272,A,they do say so
p00273_A,00273,A,it will be a novel dealing with modern italy let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know
p00274_A,00274,A,let me finish the story miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said she went at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience
p00275_A,00275,A,no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling
p00276_A,00276,A,a nice fellow he will work off his crudities in time i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully
p00277_A,00277,A,how do you do miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive would you come too
p00278_A,00278,A,i met them on the hill your brother told me
p00279_A,00279,A,i needn t say that it will go no further
p00280_A,00280,A,if you ll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing
p00281_A,00281,A,i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise
p00282_A,00282,A,i am very sorry for that
p00283_A,00283,A,still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you
p00284_A,00284,A,i have had an absurd letter from miss alan that was really what brought me over i thought it might amuse you all
p00285_A,00285,A,next week i gather
p00286_A,00286,A,no he didn t
p00287_A,00287,A,i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast
p00288_A,00288,A,has italy filled you with the fever of travel perhaps george emerson is right he says that
p00289_A,00289,A,with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe i didn t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa
p00290_A,00290,A,would your mother spare you again so soon you have scarcely been home three months
p00291_A,00291,A,you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel
p00292_A,00292,A,i am afraid it has been a bothersome business
p00293_A,00293,A,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p00294_A,00294,A,it s a beautiful song and a wise one go on
p00295_A,00295,A,that s all right i counted on you two keeping each other company it s pouring again the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it did powell go round
p00296_A,00296,A,no of course i ll see how are the miss alans
p00297_A,00297,A,did you tell mr emerson about greece
p00298_A,00298,A,don t you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans now miss honeychurch go back keep warm i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling
p00299_A,00299,A,why not
p00300_A,00300,A,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p00301_A,00301,A,is he a friend of yours
p00302_A,00302,A,then i will say no more i am as it were the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing his manner was somewhat unfortunate i hope i acted for the best
p00303_A,00303,A,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p00304_A,00304,A,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p00305_A,00305,A,oh you relieve me so you think i ought to have accepted their offer you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious
p00306_A,00306,A,it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment
p00307_A,00307,A,lucy can always play
p00308_A,00308,A,we had much better let the matter drop
p00309_A,00309,A,it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street it would be death to gossip about mr vyse s dismissal at the present moment
p00310_A,00310,A,i know yet freddy ought not to have told even you one cannot be too careful
p00311_A,00311,A,i do implore absolute secrecy a chance word to a chattering friend and
p00312_A,00312,A,there i cannot agree with you in it i spy lucy s salvation
p00313_A,00313,A,she wanted to leave windy corner
p00314_A,00314,A,it is natural surely after such painful scenes that she should desire a change
p00315_A,00315,A,but my feelings are of no importance i know too well that i get on lucy s nerves our tour was a failure she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mother s money
p00316_A,00316,A,don t neglect the country round the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort
p00317_A,00317,A,no mr beebe you are wrong the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato
p00318_A,00318,A,prato they must go to prato that place is too sweetly squalid for words i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know
p00319_A,00319,A,it is i who am sorry literary hacks are shameless creatures i believe there s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn t pry
p00320_A,00320,A,i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people of course this is the barest outline there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist
p00321_A,00321,A,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p00322_A,00322,A,the railway oh but i shall die of course it was the railway he is the image of a porter on on the south eastern
p00323_A,00323,A,miss honeychurch listening pouf wouf you naughty girl go away
p00324_A,00324,A,no i agree it s like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls miss lucy you are to go we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear
p00325_A,00325,A,then sit you down observe my foresight
p00326_A,00326,A,we are friendly as one is in pensions
p00327_A,00327,A,you acted very naturally all the same i don t think much harm would have come of accepting
p00328_A,00328,A,i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it
p00329_A,00329,A,i hardly know george for he hasn t learnt to talk yet he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains of course he has all his father s mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist
p00330_A,00330,A,not at all i never suggested that
p00331_A,00331,A,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p00332_A,00332,A,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p00333_A,00333,A,it is terrible this havoc among the flowers
p00334_A,00334,A,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p00335_A,00335,A,she is playing again
p00336_A,00336,A,i wonder
p00337_A,00337,A,of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind
p00338_A,00338,A,quite so
p00339_A,00339,A,exactly have you heard from any bertolini people lately i believe you keep up with miss lavish it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one another s lives two three four six of us no eight i had forgotten the emersons have kept more or less in touch we must really give the signora a testimonial we shan t have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on the darkness last night was appalling i have been thinking miss bartlett and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion nothing about the past i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin s credit she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her but the future seriously what do you think of this greek plan i don t know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career it s all i can t explain it s wrong i can t see the point of it myself
p00340_A,00340,A,really now why
p00341_A,00341,A,i know but it seems so odd so unlike her so i was going to say selfish
p00342_A,00342,A,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p00343_A,00343,A,let us keep to the future though i want your advice
p00344_A,00344,A,but here you are as safe as in england signora bertolini is so english
p00345_A,00345,A,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p00346_A,00346,A,yet our rooms smell we dread going to bed
p00347_A,00347,A,mr emerson is engaged but here is his son instead
p00348_A,00348,A,and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here
p00349_A,00349,A,when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose for example it isn t purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect
p00350_A,00350,A,and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch
p00351_A,00351,A,looking at italian art there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it
p00352_A,00352,A,a smell a true florentine smell every city let me teach you has its own smell
p00353_A,00353,A,one doesn t come to italy for niceness one comes for life buon giorno buon giorno look at that adorable wine cart how the driver stares at us dear simple soul buon giorno take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors that is the true democracy though i am a real radical as well there now you re shocked
p00354_A,00354,A,i see i see and now you have gone over to the enemy
p00355_A,00355,A,shameful a manufacturing district i suppose
p00356_A,00356,A,what a delightful part i know it so well it is full of the very nicest people do you know sir harry otway a radical if ever there was
p00357_A,00357,A,and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist
p00358_A,00358,A,oh you have property in surrey
p00359_A,00359,A,bless us bless us and save us we ve lost the way lost lost my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us what are we to do two lone females in an unknown town now this is what i call an adventure oh but that is the word of a craven and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker give it to me i shan t let you carry it we will simply drift stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them i do detest conventional intercourse nasty they are going into the church too oh the britisher abroad
p00360_A,00360,A,look at their figures they walk through my italy like a pair of cows it s very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldn t pass it
p00361_A,00361,A,aha miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning but perhaps you would rather not
p00362_A,00362,A,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p00363_A,00363,A,is it a very nice smell
p00364_A,00364,A,indeed i m not we are radicals too out and out my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland
p00365_A,00365,A,oh please if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp
p00366_A,00366,A,no in the surrey hills about five miles from dorking looking over the weald
p00367_A,00367,A,very well indeed
p00368_A,00368,A,why she rents a field of us how funny
p00369_A,00369,A,hardly any only thirty acres just the garden all downhill and some fields
p00370_A,00370,A,we sat opposite them at dinner last night they have given us their rooms they were so very kind
p00371_A,00371,A,what would you ask us
p00372_A,00372,A,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p00373_A,00373,A,oh dear me no oh no
p00374_A,00374,A,i m sure it s all right the emersons won t hear and they wouldn t mind if they did
p00375_A,00375,A,please i d rather stop here with you
p00376_A,00376,A,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p00377_A,00377,A,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p00378_A,00378,A,don t let us spoil yours have you looked at those saints
p00379_A,00379,A,why will he look at that fresco i saw nothing in it
p00380_A,00380,A,so you ought a baby is worth a dozen saints and my baby s worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell in hell he s unhappy
p00381_A,00381,A,how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is
p00382_A,00382,A,the old trouble things won t fit
p00383_A,00383,A,the things of the universe it is quite true they don t
p00384_A,00384,A,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p00385_A,00385,A,poor girl poor girl
p00386_A,00386,A,george don t go george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon
p00387_A,00387,A,oh miss honeychurch that you should come miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry george is so sorry he thought he had a right to try i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first he ought not to have tried i knew nothing about it at all but you must not scold him i taught him to trust in love i said i said true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result poor boy he is so sorry he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean yet miss honeychurch do you remember italy
p00388_A,00388,A,but you do remember it
p00389_A,00389,A,i only was told that he loved you last sunday i never could judge behaviour i i suppose he has
p00390_A,00390,A,not abominably he only tried when he should not have tried you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love do not go out of george s life saying he is abominable
p00391_A,00391,A,especially as he has gone under
p00392_A,00392,A,gone under naturally
p00393_A,00393,A,as his mother did
p00394_A,00394,A,when i wouldn t have george baptized and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round she thought it a judgement oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents oh horrible worst of all worse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again a judgement and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church is it possible miss honeychurch shall we slip back into the darkness for ever
p00395_A,00395,A,but mr eager he came when i was out and acted according to his principles i don t blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it
p00396_A,00396,A,he was not baptized i did hold firm my boy shall go back to the earth untouched oh last sunday george last sunday no not ill just gone under he is never ill but he is his mother s son her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live it was always touch and go he will live but he will not think it worth while to live he will never think anything worth while you remember that church at florence after you left florence horrible then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better you saw him bathing
p00397_A,00397,A,then there came something about a novel i didn t follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old ah well one must have failures george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms he can t bear to be about here and i must be where he is
p00398_A,00398,A,how good everyone is and look at mr beebe housing me came over this morning and heard i was going here i am so comfortable with a fire
p00399_A,00399,A,i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he can t he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you i am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened
p00400_A,00400,A,all the way to greece to greece
p00401_A,00401,A,certainly you can we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen
p00402_A,00402,A,i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george no it was wrong of george to try we have pushed our beliefs too far i fancy that we deserve sorrow
p00403_A,00403,A,miss honeychurch you do sound tired
p00404_A,00404,A,but you are and there s a look of george about you and what were you saying about going abroad greece greece but you were to be married this year i thought
p00405_A,00405,A,i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse
p00406_A,00406,A,you are leaving him you are leaving the man you love
p00407_A,00407,A,why miss honeychurch why my dear i am worried about you it seems to me that you are in a muddle take an old man s word there s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful it is on my muddles that i look back with horror on the things that i might have avoided we can help one another but little i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren t do you remember before when you refused the room with the view those were muddles little but ominous and i am fearing that you are in one now don t trust me miss honeychurch though life is very glorious it is difficult wrote a friend of mine i think he puts it well man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along especially the function of love that s it that s what i mean you love george but you do you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it you won t marry the other man for his sake
p00408_A,00408,A,but you are you re shocked but i mean to shock you it s the only hope at times i can reach you no other way you must marry or your life will be wasted you have gone too far to retreat i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry i know that with george you will find them and that you love him then be his wife he is already part of you though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die it isn t possible to love and to part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ah for a little directness to liberate the soul your soul dear lucy i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round but we have souls i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours i cannot bear it it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell what nonsense i have talked how abstract and remote and i have made you cry dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love marry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made then lucy
p00409_A,00409,A,i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george they have loved one another all along
p00410_A,00410,A,it is not rubbish it s the part of people that you don t understand
p00411_A,00411,A,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p00412_A,00412,A,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p00413_A,00413,A,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p00414_A,00414,A,my father has that effect on nearly everyone he will try to be kind
p00415_A,00415,A,because we think it improves our characters but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened
p00416_A,00416,A,miss bartlett
p00417_A,00417,A,in the nave
p00418_A,00418,A,you fainted

p00424_A,00424,A,then i don t fetch your photographs
p00425_A,00425,A,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p00426_A,00426,A,things i didn t want
p00427_A,00427,A,i didn t know what to do with them they were covered with blood there i m glad i ve told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them they ve gone i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the sea i don t know i may just mean that they frightened me for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled it isn t exactly that a man has died it has happened and i mean to find out what it is
p00428_A,00428,A,i want to ask you something before we go in
p00429_A,00429,A,i nearly fainted myself
p00430_A,00430,A,oh all right
p00431_A,00431,A,i m afraid i don t
p00432_A,00432,A,your behaviour oh yes all right all right
p00433_A,00433,A,i don t i shall probably want to live
p00434_A,00434,A,and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up what do you think
p00435_A,00435,A,you and are you tired
p00436_A,00436,A,do you mind being beaten
p00437_A,00437,A,i never said i was
p00438_A,00438,A,you didn t attend
p00439_A,00439,A,of course i do i saw her the day i arrived at summer street it was she who told me that you lived here
p00440_A,00440,A,i never notice much difference in views
p00441_A,00441,A,he told us another day that views are really crowds crowds of trees and houses and hills and are bound to resemble each other like human crowds and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason for a crowd is more than the people who make it up something gets added to it no one knows how just as something has got added to those hills
p00442_A,00442,A,none why
p00443_A,00443,A,my mother i was meaning
p00444_A,00444,A,am i really to go
p00445_A,00445,A,no nothing to eat
p00446_A,00446,A,but i can t
p00447_A,00447,A,you don t mean you don t mean that you are going to marry that man
p00448_A,00448,A,you cannot live with vyse he s only for an acquaintance he is for society and cultivated talk he should know no one intimately least of all a woman have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired
p00449_A,00449,A,no but have you ever he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things books pictures but kill when they come to people that s why i ll speak out through all this muddle even now it s shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person i would never have let myself go but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour that is the man all over playing tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no cecil all over again he daren t let a woman decide he s the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years every moment of his life he s forming you telling you what s charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon therefore not because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control i m not ashamed i don t apologize but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly but therefore therefore i settled to fight him
p00450_A,00450,A,lucy be quick there s no time for us to talk now come to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain i have cared for you since that man died i cannot live without you i thought but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered i called i wanted to live and have my chance of joy
p00451_A,00451,A,why shouldn t i be a baby
p00452_A,00452,A,quite right it is nonsense
p00453_A,00453,A,why shouldn t i laugh what s there to cry at kiss me here any letters
p00454_A,00454,A,now kiss me here then here lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows
p00455_A,00455,A,anything good in freddy s letter
p00456_A,00456,A,what does he say
p00457_A,00457,A,you may well wish that
p00458_A,00458,A,oh bother that man
p00459_A,00459,A,look at the lights going over the bridge
p00460_A,00460,A,but she did know she did see my father surely he said so
p00461_A,00461,A,my father saw her and i prefer his word he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett a few minutes before you came in she was turning to go as he woke up he didn t speak to her it s clear that she knew then why did she risk the meeting she knew he was there and yet she went to church
p00462_A,00462,A,or did she mean it
p00463_A,00463,A,is it this is this possible i ll put a marvel to you that your cousin has always hoped that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like this of course very far down that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped i can t explain her any other way can you look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable the sight of us haunted her or she couldn t have described us as she did to her friend there are details it burnt i read the book afterwards she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy we can never make friends with her or thank her but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad
p00464_A,00464,A,i am not touchy i hope it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are
p00465_A,00465,A,i hope we all try
p00466_A,00466,A,oh good gracious me where where
p00467_A,00467,A,oh what have i done
p00468_A,00468,A,i i am very sorry
p00469_A,00469,A,perfectly well absolutely well
p00470_A,00470,A,how very kind you have been i might have hurt myself falling but now i am well i can go alone thank you oh my photographs
p00471_A,00471,A,i bought some photographs at alinari s i must have dropped them out there in the square would you add to your kindness by fetching them
p00472_A,00472,A,yes i am thank you so very much
p00473_A,00473,A,but i had rather
p00474_A,00474,A,i had rather be alone
p00475_A,00475,A,and the murderer tried to kiss him you say how very odd italians are and gave himself up to the police mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterday what was that what did you throw in
p00476_A,00476,A,where are the photographs i believe it was my photographs that you threw away
p00477_A,00477,A,mr emerson
p00478_A,00478,A,i have behaved ridiculously i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me
p00479_A,00479,A,well i owe you a thousand apologies
p00480_A,00480,A,and this is the real point you know how silly people are gossiping ladies especially i am afraid you understand what i mean
p00481_A,00481,A,i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour
p00482_A,00482,A,thank you so much and would you well thank you so much how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life
p00483_A,00483,A,but why mr emerson what do you mean
p00484_A,00484,A,what fun cecil read away come mr emerson sit down after all your energy
p00485_A,00485,A,of course i m not
p00486_A,00486,A,yes i don t see you re such a splendid player though the light was behind you and it was in my eyes
p00487_A,00487,A,why you did
p00488_A,00488,A,oh a dreadful person mr emerson you remember miss lavish
p00489_A,00489,A,how do you like this view of ours mr emerson
p00490_A,00490,A,what do you mean
p00491_A,00491,A,what a splendid idea i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again i m so sorry he s not so well
p00492_A,00492,A,mr emerson have you any brothers or sisters
p00493_A,00493,A,you spoke of
p00494_A,00494,A,no discussion
p00495_A,00495,A,go please i do not want to call in mr vyse
p00496_A,00496,A,you are merely ridiculous
p00497_A,00497,A,i can scarcely discuss
p00498_A,00498,A,you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit
p00499_A,00499,A,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p00500_A,00500,A,no it isn t because it is the room i had and i had your father s room i forget why charlotte made me for some reason george you baby get up
p00501_A,00501,A,oh bother charlotte what can such people be made of
p00502_A,00502,A,now you get up off the cold floor or you ll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly
p00503_A,00503,A,just a line from freddy
p00504_A,00504,A,not yet
p00505_A,00505,A,but it will all come right in the end he has to build us both up from the beginning again i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women he has for the second time quite altered why will men have theories about women i haven t any about men i wish too that mr beebe
p00506_A,00506,A,he will never forgive us i mean he will never be interested in us again i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner i wish he hadn t but if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run
p00507_A,00507,A,no don t be rude to him mr eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte how cruel she would be to a man like that
p00508_A,00508,A,but this room reminds me of charlotte how horrible to grow old in charlotte s way to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn t have heard your father was in the house for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense you couldn t have made me when i am very happy i remember on how little it all hangs if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever
p00509_A,00509,A,oh no she didn t see him she was upstairs with old mrs beebe don t you remember and then went straight to the church she said so
p00510_A,00510,A,how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment
p00511_A,00511,A,mean what george
p00512_A,00512,A,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p00513_A,00513,A,it happened like this if it happened at all i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here
p00514_A,00514,A,perhaps he is i don t remember
p00515_A,00515,A,were you snubbed
p00516_A,00516,A,i i ll come up to tennis if i can manage it
p00517_A,00517,A,pardon me the chapel is somewhat small for two parties we will incommode you no longer
p00518_A,00518,A,victory at last
p00519_A,00519,A,would render a correct meaning
p00520_A,00520,A,who is she
p00521_A,00521,A,introduce me
p00522_A,00522,A,cousin of one of my parishioners i do not consider her choice of a piece happy beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs
p00523_A,00523,A,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p00524_A,00524,A,fa niente sono vecchia
p00525_A,00525,A,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p00526_A,00526,A,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p00527_A,00527,A,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p00528_A,00528,A,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable
p00529_A,00529,A,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p00530_A,00530,A,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p00531_A,00531,A,italians dear you know
p00532_A,00532,A,what was that
p00533_A,00533,A,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p00534_A,00534,A,oh let me congratulate you after your despair of yesterday what a fortunate thing
p00535_A,00535,A,i do hope she s nice and what is the plot
p00536_A,00536,A,oh you wicked woman i am sure you are thinking of the emersons
p00537_A,00537,A,how tired one gets oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here
p00538_A,00538,A,she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word none but the superficial would be shocked at her we had a long talk yesterday she believes in justice and truth and human interest she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman mr eager why how nice what a pleasant surprise
p00539_A,00539,A,we were chatting to miss lavish
p00540_A,00540,A,humiliating indeed miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened she can hardly bear to speak of it
p00541_A,00541,A,do not blame her please mr eager the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned
p00542_A,00542,A,one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home
p00543_A,00543,A,willingly would i purchase
p00544_A,00544,A,how wonderfully people rise in these days
p00545_A,00545,A,is he a journalist now
p00546_A,00546,A,oh so he has a wife
p00547_A,00547,A,lucy dear
p00548_A,00548,A,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p00549_A,00549,A,ah not for me for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time
p00550_A,00550,A,so i saw were you indeed andate via sono occupato i am about to venture a suggestion would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week a drive in the hills we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour s ramble on the hillside the view thence of florence is most beautiful far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures that man had a decided feeling for landscape decidedly but who looks at it to day ah the world is too much for us so we shall be a partie carree in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity andate via andate presto presto ah the town beautiful as it is it is the town this very square so i am told witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration portentous and humiliating
p00551_A,00551,A,and how came we to have you here
p00552_A,00552,A,that must have saved you much you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press this man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views this is too much
p00553_A,00553,A,ignore him
p00554_A,00554,A,generally one has only sympathy for their success the desire for education and for social advance in these things there is something not wholly vile there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence little as they would make of it
p00555_A,00555,A,he is not he made an advantageous marriage
p00556_A,00556,A,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p00557_A,00557,A,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p00558_A,00558,A,and you and your friend
p00559_A,00559,A,to speak plainly it is i will say no more
p00560_A,00560,A,to all intents and purposes he murdered her that day in santa croce did they say anything against me
p00561_A,00561,A,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p00562_A,00562,A,i must be going
p00563_A,00563,A,so miss honeychurch you are travelling as a student of art
p00564_A,00564,A,courage miss honeychurch courage and faith if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me
p00565_A,00565,A,typical behaviour in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down
p00566_A,00566,A,he died by the fountain i believe
p00567_A,00567,A,were over at the loggia
p00568_A,00568,A,you have said very little
p00569_A,00569,A,not a word mr eager not a single word

p00573_A,00573,A,quite so now the english colony at florence miss honeychurch and it is of considerable size though of course not all equally a few are here for trade for example but the greater part are students lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left no you can only see it if you stand no do not stand you will fall she is very proud of that thick hedge inside perfect seclusion one might have gone back six hundred years some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not
p00574_A,00574,A,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p00575_A,00575,A,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p00576_A,00576,A,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day

p00583_A,00583,A,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature

p00605_A,00605,A,it s his third go isn t it
p00606_A,00606,A,i didn t mean to be unkind but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy i don t know how girls manage things but she can t have said properly before or she wouldn t have to say it again now over the whole thing i can t explain i do feel so uncomfortable
p00607_A,00607,A,i feel never mind
p00608_A,00608,A,yes mother you told me a jolly good letter
p00609_A,00609,A,nor me
p00610_A,00610,A,he asked me for my permission also
p00611_A,00611,A,why so why shouldn t my permission be asked
p00612_A,00612,A,i said to cecil
p00613_A,00613,A,the bother is this
p00614_A,00614,A,i don t see you ought to go peeping like that
p00615_A,00615,A,the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully not content with permission which i did give that is to say i said well not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasn t off my head with joy he practically put it like this wasn t it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her and he would have an answer he said it would strengthen his hand
p00616_A,00616,A,i answered no there fly into a stew i can t help it had to say it i had to say no he ought never to have asked me
p00617_A,00617,A,oh do keep quiet mother i had to say no when i couldn t say yes i tried to laugh as if i didn t mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right but i feel my foot s in it oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work
p00618_A,00618,A,not a bit i only let out i didn t like him i don t hate him but i don t like him what i mind is that he ll tell lucy
p00619_A,00619,A,i liked him till just now i suppose it s having him spoiling lucy s first week at home and it s also something that mr beebe said not knowing
p00620_A,00620,A,you know mr beebe s funny way when you never quite know what he means he said i was very cute i asked him what he meant he said i couldn t make him say any more but it set me thinking since cecil has come after lucy he hasn t been so pleasant at least i can t explain
p00621_A,00621,A,suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country
p00622_A,00622,A,cross it out too
p00623_A,00623,A,look out

p00634_A,00634,A,for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then i think things are coming to a head
p00635_A,00635,A,i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more
p00636_A,00636,A,freddy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00637_A,00637,A,do you indeed dear how interesting
p00638_A,00638,A,just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse i said dear mrs vyse
p00639_A,00639,A,i said i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth when it comes to the point he can t get on without me
p00640_A,00640,A,you what do you mean
p00641_A,00641,A,how very odd of him
p00642_A,00642,A,what do you know about lucy or girls or anything what ever did you say
p00643_A,00643,A,what a helpful answer
p00644_A,00644,A,freddy you must come there they still are
p00645_A,00645,A,peeping like that can t i look out of my own window still page 322
p00646_A,00646,A,i hope you gave a careful answer dear
p00647_A,00647,A,ridiculous child you think you re so holy and truthful but really it s only abominable conceit do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say i hope he boxed your ears how dare you say no
p00648_A,00648,A,no i shall not keep quiet you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house
p00649_A,00649,A,well i like him i know his mother he s good he s clever he s rich he s well connected oh you needn t kick the piano he s well connected i ll say it again if you like he s well connected and he has beautiful manners
p00650_A,00650,A,mr beebe i don t see how mr beebe comes in
p00651_A,00651,A,you never can dear but i can you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties will this do then i put in at the top i must write the letter out again i said that because i didn t want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maid s dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light she keeps that flat abominably
p00652_A,00652,A,don t interrupt so foolishly where was i oh yes no i ll cross that last bit out it looks patronizing i ll stop at or shall i cross that out too
p00653_A,00653,A,then the whole thing runs
p00654_A,00654,A,hush dear
p00655_A,00655,A,emerson freddy do you know what emersons they are
p00656_A,00656,A,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p00657_A,00657,A,murdered his wife lucy don t desert us go on playing bumble puppy really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place that s the second murderer i ve heard of as being there whatever was charlotte doing to stop by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time
p00658_A,00658,A,good gracious me dear so it s you what miserable management why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on
p00659_A,00659,A,dear no doubt you re right as usual but you are in no position to argue come lucy oh look don t look oh poor mr beebe how unfortunate again
p00660_A,00660,A,then depend upon it it is the boiler i know myself how water preys upon one s mind i would rather anything else even a misfortune with the meat
p00661_A,00661,A,this isn t very kind of you two you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old
p00662_A,00662,A,mr beebe i m thankful simply thankful
p00663_A,00663,A,oh cecil oh cecil do tell me
p00664_A,00664,A,i am so glad welcome as one of the family this is indeed a joyous day i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy

p00667_A,00667,A,plenty of society
p00668_A,00668,A,difference i don t see any difference fences are fences especially when they are in the same place
p00669_A,00669,A,oh i see dear poetry i tell you who has no as you call them and that s mr beebe
p00670_A,00670,A,let s hope that mrs harris there warn t no sich person
p00671_A,00671,A,my goodness gracious me child you ll blow my head off whatever is there to shout over i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen
p00672_A,00672,A,men don t gossip over tea cups if they get drunk there s an end of them they lie down comfortably and sleep it off if they re vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves it doesn t spread so give me a man of course provided he s clean
p00673_A,00673,A,gracious alive whoever were those unfortunate people oh dears look away and poor mr beebe too whatever has happened
p00674_A,00674,A,oh poor mr beebe was that his waistcoat we left in the path cecil mr beebe s waistcoat
p00675_A,00675,A,i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond
p00676_A,00676,A,then if you re so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy
p00677_A,00677,A,i promessi sposi she has accepted me
p00678_A,00678,A,i hope so
p00679_A,00679,A,we were speaking of motives
p00680_A,00680,A,come this way immediately
p00681_A,00681,A,no business of ours
p00682_A,00682,A,he is the clever sort like myself
p00683_A,00683,A,hear hear
p00684_A,00684,A,i say lucy
p00685_A,00685,A,would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it and i d stop here and tell my mother
p00686_A,00686,A,i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well
p00687_A,00687,A,we go with lucy
p00688_A,00688,A,i didn t mean the egg was well boiled because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i don t care for eggs i only meant how jolly kind she seemed
p00689_A,00689,A,mr beebe
p00690_A,00690,A,i ve come for tea mr vyse do you suppose that i shall get it
p00691_A,00691,A,i ve come for tea and for gossip isn t this news
p00692_A,00692,A,i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack
p00693_A,00693,A,unpardonable question to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church i ll set mrs honeychurch after you
p00694_A,00694,A,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession
p00695_A,00695,A,you are very fortunate it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure
p00696_A,00696,A,oh freddy s a good sort isn t he
p00697_A,00697,A,where are the others i insist on extracting tea before evening service
p00698_A,00698,A,i know the faults of mary she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs
p00699_A,00699,A,ah he has too many no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable
p00700_A,00700,A,i quite agree at present she has none
p00701_A,00701,A,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad
p00702_A,00702,A,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be
p00703_A,00703,A,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks
p00704_A,00704,A,no i mightn t have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall
p00705_A,00705,A,broken what do you mean
p00706_A,00706,A,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me
p00707_A,00707,A,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you
p00708_A,00708,A,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her
p00709_A,00709,A,i know i know i can t think why mrs honeychurch allows it
p00710_A,00710,A,news i don t understand you news
p00711_A,00711,A,has he indeed
p00712_A,00712,A,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance
p00713_A,00713,A,i have no profession it is another example of my decadence my attitude quite an indefensible one is that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i don t care a straw about but somehow i ve not been able to begin
p00714_A,00714,A,i am glad that you approve i daren t face the healthy person for example freddy honeychurch
p00715_A,00715,A,admirable the sort who has made england what she is
p00716_A,00716,A,i suppose anne never told them you were here in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet the faults of mary i forget the faults of mary but they are very grave shall we look in the garden
p00717_A,00717,A,the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small the faults of freddy
p00718_A,00718,A,she has none
p00719_A,00719,A,at present
p00720_A,00720,A,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes
p00721_A,00721,A,in what way
p00722_A,00722,A,but the string never broke
p00723_A,00723,A,it has broken now
p00724_A,00724,A,i meant that she is going to marry me
p00725_A,00725,A,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval
p00726_A,00726,A,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet
p00727_A,00727,A,have you heard oh mr beebe have you heard the news
p00728_A,00728,A,here lennie the bass
p00729_A,00729,A,oh must you yes do not the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full already i m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it yes charlotte i don t want you do go there s nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it
p00730_A,00730,A,it gets too dark this comes of putting off we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece i don t know what the world s coming to
p00731_A,00731,A,i don t see why greece is necessary but as you do i suppose it is all right it must be something i can t understand lucy let s tell her lucy
p00732_A,00732,A,indeed i have mrs honeychurch i m going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally i m too shy i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother and now i want my tea
p00733_A,00733,A,but they really are coming now i wrote to miss teresa a few days ago she was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably they are coming i heard from them this morning
p00734_A,00734,A,these particular emersons consisted of a father and a son the son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immature pessimism et cetera our special joy was the father such a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife
p00735_A,00735,A,hi hi ladies
p00736_A,00736,A,come for a walk with me you have worried them as much as they can stand mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may
p00737_A,00737,A,mrs honeychurch go to greece she must come up to the house and let s talk it over do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse
p00738_A,00738,A,good now come up to the house
p00739_A,00739,A,she is playing the piano i didn t know that miss honeychurch sang too
p00740_A,00740,A,do you go to much of this sort of thing
p00741_A,00741,A,is it typical of country society
p00742_A,00742,A,to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous
p00743_A,00743,A,not that but the congratulations it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment all those old women smirking
p00744_A,00744,A,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such
p00745_A,00745,A,i don t play tennis at least not in public the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato
p00746_A,00746,A,e un diavolo incarnato you know the proverb well i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them
p00747_A,00747,A,a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless
p00748_A,00748,A,i never said so i consider him far above the average i only denied
p00749_A,00749,A,what sort of things
p00750_A,00750,A,isn t mr eager a parson of the cultured type
p00751_A,00751,A,i count myself a lucky person when i m in london i feel i could never live out of it when i m in the country i feel the same about the country after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best it s true that in nine cases out of ten they don t seem to notice anything the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town do you feel that mrs honeychurch
p00752_A,00752,A,let us take mrs honeychurch s advice and hate clergymen no more what s this place
p00753_A,00753,A,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p00754_A,00754,A,hopeless vulgarian
p00755_A,00755,A,i can t help it it would be wrong not to loathe that man
p00756_A,00756,A,no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life in london he would keep his place he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyone even your mother is taken in
p00757_A,00757,A,it matters supremely sir harry is the essence of that garden party oh goodness how cross i feel how i do hope he ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa some woman so really vulgar that he ll notice it gentlefolks ugh with his bald head and retreating chin but let s forget him
p00758_A,00758,A,are there two ways
p00759_A,00759,A,i d rather go through the wood why is it lucy that you always say the road do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged
p00760_A,00760,A,i had got an idea i dare say wrongly that you feel more at home with me in a room
p00761_A,00761,A,yes or at the most in a garden or on a road never in the real country like this
p00762_A,00762,A,i don t know that you aren t i connect you with a view a certain type of view why shouldn t you connect me with a room
p00763_A,00763,A,a drawing room pray with no view
p00764_A,00764,A,i d rather that you connected me with the open air
p00765_A,00765,A,why do you call it that

p00775_A,00775,A,friends of mine but lucy the whole joke is to come come here do you know where i met these desirable tenants in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week
p00776_A,00776,A,in the umbrian room absolute strangers they were admiring luca signorelli of course quite stupidly however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little they had been to italy
p00777_A,00777,A,in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage the father to live there the son to run down for week ends i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they weren t actual blackguards it was great sport and wrote to him making out
p00778_A,00778,A,perfectly fair anything is fair that punishes a snob that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long you ll agree with me there ought to be intermarriage all sorts of things i believe in democracy
p00779_A,00779,A,no you don t
p00780_A,00780,A,so you do love me little thing
p00781_A,00781,A,miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett

p00789_A,00789,A,now a clergyman that i do hate a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr eager the english chaplain at florence he was truly insincere not merely the manner unfortunate he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things
p00790_A,00790,A,there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife
p00791_A,00791,A,what height
p00792_A,00792,A,the misses alan aren t that
p00793_A,00793,A,oh cecil
p00794_A,00794,A,he isn t clever but really he is nice
p00795_A,00795,A,all that you say is quite true i wonder whether whether it matters so very much
p00796_A,00796,A,which way shall we go
p00797_A,00797,A,perhaps the road is more sensible as we re got up smart
p00798_A,00798,A,haven t i the wood then
p00799_A,00799,A,a room
p00800_A,00800,A,oh cecil whatever do you mean i have never felt anything of the sort you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person
p00801_A,00801,A,do you know that you re right i do i must be a poetess after all when i think of you it s always as in a room how funny
p00802_A,00802,A,yes with no view i fancy why not
p00803_A,00803,A,oh cecil whatever do you mean the sacred lake
p00804_A,00804,A,i can t remember why i suppose it comes out of some book it s only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and can t get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful then freddy used to bathe there he is very fond of it
p00805_A,00805,A,i bathed here too till i was found out then there was a row
p00806_A,00806,A,charlotte she was stopping with us charlotte charlotte
p00807_A,00807,A,yes i suppose we ought to be going

p00812_A,00812,A,i have heard freddy has told us naughty cecil i suppose i must forgive you just think of all the trouble i took for nothing certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and i d rather have nice friends of yours but you oughtn t to tease one so
p00813_A,00813,A,what an odd place to meet people i don t quite understand
p00814_A,00814,A,but cecil
p00815_A,00815,A,cecil no it s not fair i ve probably met them before

p00818_A,00818,A,oh cecil i do i do i don t know what i should do without you
p00819_A,00819,A,ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here
p00820_A,00820,A,no i don t and no more does cecil she gets on our nerves you haven t seen her lately and don t realize how tiresome she can be though so good so please mother don t worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come
p00821_A,00821,A,well she would leave florence so stupidly she flurried
p00822_A,00822,A,i suppose so mother would it be
p00823_A,00823,A,we weren t talking of real fences
p00824_A,00824,A,he was such a nice old man i m sure well i did try to sift the thing mr eager would never come to the point he prefers it vague said the old man had practically murdered his wife had murdered her in the sight of god
p00825_A,00825,A,i don t know i hate him i ve heard him lecture on giotto i hate him nothing can hide a petty nature i hate him
p00826_A,00826,A,summer street of course
p00827_A,00827,A,what a weathercock sir harry is i wish i had never bothered over it at all
p00828_A,00828,A,emerson s a common enough name
p00829_A,00829,A,no i don t think so mother cecil s all right
p00830_A,00830,A,i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that
p00831_A,00831,A,let me just put your bonnet away may i
p00832_A,00832,A,cecil has a very high standard for people it s part of his ideals it is really that that makes him sometimes seem
p00833_A,00833,A,now mother i ve seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself
p00834_A,00834,A,by the by i never told you i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london
p00835_A,00835,A,i i see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtn t to but he does not mean to be uncivil he once explained it is the things that upset him he is easily upset by ugly things he is not uncivil to people
p00836_A,00836,A,you can t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do
p00837_A,00837,A,we mustn t be unjust to people
p00838_A,00838,A,all right mother
p00839_A,00839,A,yes i really can t stop i must dress too
p00840_A,00840,A,all right
p00841_A,00841,A,her what
p00842_A,00842,A,i can t remember all charlotte s worries i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil
p00843_A,00843,A,oh very slightly i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did
p00844_A,00844,A,one thing and another among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if she d come up and see us and mercifully didn t
p00845_A,00845,A,i tore the thing up
p00846_A,00846,A,oh yes i suppose so no not very cheerful i suppose
p00847_A,00847,A,mother no it s impossible we can t have charlotte on the top of the other things we re squeezed to death as it is freddy s got a friend coming tuesday there s cecil and you ve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare it simply can t be done
p00848_A,00848,A,if minnie sleeps in the bath not otherwise
p00849_A,00849,A,i won t have her
p00850_A,00850,A,it s impossible i don t want to make difficulties but it really isn t fair on the maids to fill up the house so
p00851_A,00851,A,i can t help it mother i don t like charlotte i admit it s horrid of me
p00852_A,00852,A,it s only the library book that cecil s been reading
p00853_A,00853,A,thank you mother that doesn t matter a bit
p00854_A,00854,A,oh splendid oh thank you
p00855_A,00855,A,that s all right we just got through that time
p00856_A,00856,A,because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england i shall tell them then it s much pleasanter how wet it is let s turn in here oh well let it be shop then let s go to mudie s i ll buy a guide book
p00857_A,00857,A,it s only for a few days
p00858_A,00858,A,oh mother what rubbish you talk of course i m not tired of windy corner
p00859_A,00859,A,half a minute would be nearer
p00860_A,00860,A,hush mother people will hear you of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been you see i come into my money next year i ve seen the world so little i felt so out of things in italy i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london more not a cheap ticket like to day but to stop i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl
p00861_A,00861,A,i want more independence
p00862_A,00862,A,perhaps i spoke hastily
p00863_A,00863,A,i don t know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike
p00864_A,00864,A,what rubbish and if you dislike charlotte so it s rather a pity you asked her to stop i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to
p00865_A,00865,A,i beg your pardon
p00866_A,00866,A,can t we have the hood down
p00867_A,00867,A,my dear cecil look here this is me that s windy corner the rest of the pattern is the other people motives are all very well but the fence comes here
p00868_A,00868,A,i shall hate those miss alans just because they re old and silly one s expected to say how sweet i hate their if ing and but ing and and ing and poor lucy serve her right worn to a shadow
p00869_A,00869,A,oh good gracious there isn t going to be another muddle do you notice lucy i m always right i said don t interfere with cissie villa i m always right i m quite uneasy at being always right so often
p00870_A,00870,A,i trust they are the right sort of person all right lucy i see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother s a snob but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and it s affectation to pretend there isn t
p00871_A,00871,A,don t be rude dear lucy don t screech it s a new bad habit you re getting into
p00872_A,00872,A,hush dears and do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first all these colds come of not drying thoroughly
p00873_A,00873,A,bow lucy better bow whoever is it i shall bow
p00874_A,00874,A,lucy is anything the matter with cecil
p00875_A,00875,A,perhaps he s tired because otherwise because otherwise i cannot account for him
p00876_A,00876,A,cecil has told you to think so you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever no it is just the same thing everywhere
p00877_A,00877,A,surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour
p00878_A,00878,A,oh rubbish if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better
p00879_A,00879,A,not in that way at times i could wring her neck but not in that way no it is the same with cecil all over
p00880_A,00880,A,since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him whenever i speak he winces i see him lucy it is useless to contradict me no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember
p00881_A,00881,A,is it a thing or a person when freddy sings
p00882_A,00882,A,then why didn t he leave the room why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone s pleasure
p00883_A,00883,A,go and dress dear you ll be late
p00884_A,00884,A,don t say and stop go
p00885_A,00885,A,lucy what a noise you re making i have something to say to you did you say you had had a letter from charlotte
p00886_A,00886,A,how s charlotte
p00887_A,00887,A,lucy you ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one s sentences did charlotte mention her boiler
p00888_A,00888,A,don t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings
p00889_A,00889,A,how well did you know them at the bertolini
p00890_A,00890,A,oh that reminds me you never told me what charlotte said in her letter
p00891_A,00891,A,lucy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00892_A,00892,A,i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlotte s how is she
p00893_A,00893,A,didn t she say how she was how does she sound cheerful
p00894_A,00894,A,and i have been thinking surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at tunbridge wells finish i have not seen poor charlotte for so long
p00895_A,00895,A,nonsense it can
p00896_A,00896,A,minnie can sleep with you
p00897_A,00897,A,the truth is dear you don t like charlotte
p00898_A,00898,A,i know dear she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return
p00899_A,00899,A,from your own account you told her as much
p00900_A,00900,A,lucy lucy what s that book who s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil
p00901_A,00901,A,not very dutiful
p00902_A,00902,A,all right dear i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias
p00903_A,00903,A,and you are right too greece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you
p00904_A,00904,A,here s mr beebe
p00905_A,00905,A,no one will see lucy off she doesn t like it
p00906_A,00906,A,i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic but i cannot see why you didn t tell your friends about cecil and be done with it there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant but why shouldn t it be everywhere in no time
p00907_A,00907,A,you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me i m so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work you ve got rid of cecil well and good and i m thankful he s gone though i did feel angry for the minute but why not announce it why this hushing up and tip toeing
p00908_A,00908,A,but why at all
p00909_A,00909,A,you re tired of windy corner
p00910_A,00910,A,then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour
p00911_A,00911,A,perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether
p00912_A,00912,A,and mess with typewriters and latch keys and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police and call it a mission when no one wants you and call it duty when it means that you can t stand your own home and call it work when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them
p00913_A,00913,A,very well take your independence and be gone rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear view and then share a flat with another girl
p00914_A,00914,A,more every moment
p00915_A,00915,A,well i see the likeness the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters
p00916_A,00916,A,there you go
p00917_A,00917,A,charlotte again my dear that s all her very words
p00918_A,00918,A,very well old lady stop the horse
p00919_A,00919,A,stop here s sir harry now we shall know sir harry pull those things down at once
p00920_A,00920,A,am i not always right she ought to have gone before the contract was signed does she still live rent free as she did in her nephew s time
p00921_A,00921,A,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p00922_A,00922,A,mrs honeychurch i meant to i can t i really can t turn out miss flack
p00923_A,00923,A,indeed you may here we are with the difficulty solved already how delightful it is extra facilities please tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees oh the agents the appalling people they have sent me one woman when i wrote a tactful letter you know asking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance as if one cares about that and several references i took up were most unsatisfactory people swindlers or not respectable and oh the deceit i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week the deceit of the most promising people my dear lucy the deceit
p00924_A,00924,A,but what can i do an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden
p00925_A,00925,A,the rent is absurdly low and perhaps i am an easy landlord but it is such an awkward size it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves
p00926_A,00926,A,aha young people young people
p00927_A,00927,A,and all the capitals different one with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flack s initials everyone different
p00928_A,00928,A,you ought to find a tenant at once it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk
p00929_A,00929,A,exactly that is exactly what i fear mr vyse it will attract the wrong type of people the train service has improved a fatal improvement to my mind and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles
p00930_A,00930,A,my dear lucy it would be splendid do you know any such
p00931_A,00931,A,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p00932_A,00932,A,it s i who am tiresome i oughtn t to come with my troubles to young people but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help
p00933_A,00933,A,rather a strenuous clerk it would be sir harry i have an idea how would you like spinsters
p00934_A,00934,A,yes indeed and at the present moment homeless i heard from them last week miss teresa and miss catharine alan i m really not joking they are quite the right people mr beebe knows them too may i tell them to write to you
p00935_A,00935,A,don t listen to him sir harry he s tiresome
p00936_A,00936,A,saturn s all right for bumble puppy minnie don t you listen to her
p00937_A,00937,A,saturn bounces enough
p00938_A,00938,A,that wasn t the name

p01094_A,01094,A,no of course not really
p01095_A,01095,A,it isn t worth reading it s too silly to read i never saw such rubbish it oughtn t to be allowed to be printed
p01096_A,01096,A,i am very sorry about it i have carefully thought things over we are too different i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl
p01097_A,01097,A,i haven t had a really good education for one thing my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should
p01098_A,01098,A,tired that is exactly like you you always think women don t mean what they say
p01099_A,01099,A,what if i do it doesn t prevent me from realizing the truth i can t marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day
p01100_A,01100,A,there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to you when you wouldn t play tennis with freddy
p01101_A,01101,A,you can play well enough to make up a four i thought it abominably selfish of you
p01102_A,01102,A,i knew you wouldn t understand i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations of course it isn t the tennis that was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wife for instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband i don t think so you don t like freddy nor my mother there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it until well until all things came to a point they have to day i see clearly i must speak that s all
p01103_A,01103,A,what s the good of a scene
p01104_A,01104,A,don t open the window and you d better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside i really think we had better go to bed if you don t mind i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking
p01105_A,01105,A,i did not i thought i did at first i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too
p01106_A,01106,A,because you re the sort who can t know any one intimately i don t mean exactly that but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something it is that more or less when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now you re always protecting me i won t be protected i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right to shield me is an insult can t i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you a woman s place you despise my mother i know you do because she s conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodness conventional cecil you re that for you may understand beautiful things but you don t know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me i won t be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me that s why i break off my engagement you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people
p01107_A,01107,A,true on the whole
p01108_A,01108,A,anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife
p01109_A,01109,A,what do you mean by a new voice
p01110_A,01110,A,if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken
p01111_A,01111,A,oh yes you do think it it s your old idea the idea that has kept europe back i mean the idea that women are always thinking of men if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says it s disgusting brutal as if a girl can t break it off for the sake of freedom
p01112_A,01112,A,all right cecil that will do don t apologize to me it was my mistake
p01113_A,01113,A,of course i will good night cecil good bye that s all right i m sorry about it thank you very much for your gentleness

p01117_A,01117,A,who may miss lavish be
p01118_A,01118,A,all modern books are bad every one writes for money in these days
p01119_A,01119,A,it is so i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p01120_A,01120,A,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p01121_A,01121,A,i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p01122_A,01122,A,not while mr emerson is here to entertain us
p01123_A,01123,A,chapter two find me chapter two if it isn t bothering you here hand me the book
p01124_A,01124,A,this isn t the passage i wanted there is another much funnier further on
p01125_A,01125,A,my dear freddy i am no athlete as you well remarked this very morning i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you
p01126_A,01126,A,different how how
p01127_A,01127,A,i don t understand you you aren t like yourself you re tired lucy
p01128_A,01128,A,well you sound tired as if something has worried you
p01129_A,01129,A,you had that bad headache yesterday all right i see it s much more than headaches but give me a moment s time you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other part i find it difficult i am likely to say the wrong thing
p01130_A,01130,A,i never do play tennis i never could play i don t understand a word you say
p01131_A,01131,A,no i can t well never mind the tennis why couldn t you couldn t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong you talked of our wedding at lunch at least you let me talk
p01132_A,01132,A,i cannot think you were right i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly it s all too horrible
p01133_A,01133,A,no good but surely i have a right to hear a little more
p01134_A,01134,A,but i love you and i did think you loved me
p01135_A,01135,A,you don t love me evidently i dare say you are right not to but it would hurt a little less if i knew why
p01136_A,01136,A,it is true
p01137_A,01137,A,true every word it is a revelation it is i
p01138_A,01138,A,it is true i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother you are even greater than i thought i m not going to worry you you are far too good to me i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldn t marry me and so have given me a chance to improve i have never known you till this evening i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be but this evening you are a different person new thoughts even a new voice
p01139_A,01139,A,i mean that a new person seems speaking through you
p01140_A,01140,A,of course i don t think that you are not that kind lucy
p01141_A,01141,A,i may have said that in the past i shall never say it again you have taught me better of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadn t known of up till now
p01142_A,01142,A,it is a question between ideals yours and mine pure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new i must actually thank you for what you have done for showing me what i really am solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman will you shake hands
p01143_A,01143,A,let me light your candle shall i thank you good night again god bless you lucy
p01144_A,01144,A,all right

p01148_A,01148,A,you re quite right greece is not for our little lot
p01149_A,01149,A,i am not bad
p01150_A,01150,A,because they re all alike because all that matters in them is distance and air
p01151_A,01151,A,my father says that there is only one perfect view the view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it
p01152_A,01152,A,no he isn t well
p01153_A,01153,A,then certainly i won t play
p01154_A,01154,A,i agree with you mr vyse you had much better not play much better not
p01155_A,01155,A,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p01156_A,01156,A,h m
p01157_A,01157,A,i expect your father has been reading dante
p01158_A,01158,A,mr emerson go and find tennis balls
p01159_A,01159,A,i have
p01160_A,01160,A,then you don t see the wonder of this greek visit i haven t been to greece myself and don t mean to go and i can t imagine any of my friends going it is altogether too big for our little lot don t you think so italy is just about as much as we can manage italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilish i am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus all right freddy i am not being clever upon my word i am not i took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when you ve done with them i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian big enough in all conscience the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me there the contrast is just as much as i can realize but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria
p01161_A,01161,A,they re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy won t play with me in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday
p01162_A,01162,A,but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you a gentleman is such a stand by we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you it is not every young man who would be so unselfish but perhaps he will come out and join you later on
p01163_A,01163,A,or does his work keep him in london
p01164_A,01164,A,really how funny i should have thought that in this case
p01165_A,01165,A,however we shall see him when he sees you off i do so long to see him
p01166_A,01166,A,no i hate seeings off

p00006_B,00006,B,what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised i don t think we ought to blame him very much it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesn t admire me or any of that nonsense one straw freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself he has improved he doesn t always look as if he s going to burst into tears he is a clerk in the general manager s office at one of the big railways not a porter and runs down to his father for week ends papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired there now for the garden suppose we don t talk about this silly italian business any more we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting

p00035_B,00035,B,oh bother the credit and who s been right or wrong we ve both made a muddle of it george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isn t he i want to know you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome can t you speak again to him now
p00036_B,00036,B,i want so to see the arno the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno the signora had no business to do it at all oh it is a shame
p00037_B,00037,B,cecil said one day and i thought it so profound that there are two kinds of cads the conscious and the subconscious
p00038_B,00038,B,not so that one could recognize it yes
p00039_B,00039,B,so one would have thought but things are so difficult i sometimes think
p00040_B,00040,B,no line he talked about italy like any other person it is really all right what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly i do wish i could make you see it my way he really won t be any nuisance charlotte
p00041_B,00041,B,how you do do everything
p00042_B,00042,B,i can t find them now and i don t want to either
p00043_B,00043,B,oh oh why it s mr beebe oh how perfectly lovely oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are oh
p00044_B,00044,B,he is really i think he was taken by surprise just as i was before but this time i m not to blame i want you to believe that i simply slipped into those violets no i want to be really truthful i am a little to blame i had silly thoughts the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book
p00045_B,00045,B,what train
p00046_B,00046,B,no to laugh at it
p00047_B,00047,B,i should have
p00048_B,00048,B,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p00049_B,00049,B,why did you tell her though this is a most serious thing cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again behind cecil s back ugh is it possible that men are such brutes behind cecil s back as we were walking up the garden what is to be done now can you tell me
p00050_B,00050,B,mother wouldn t mind i m sure
p00051_B,00051,B,mr beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature of course i was holding back on my cousin s account about old mr emerson i hardly know no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same time beautiful
p00052_B,00052,B,thank you charlotte
p00053_B,00053,B,well you know what i mean and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man
p00054_B,00054,B,i don t care if he does i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it
p00055_B,00055,B,i m sure she will and so will freddy
p00056_B,00056,B,and a cockney besides it might be london charlotte don t you feel too that we might be in london i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside i suppose it is one s being so tired

p00067_B,00067,B,yes but they pay extra for wine
p00068_B,00068,B,we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren t careful how could a florentine cab driver ever get hold of cecil
p00069_B,00069,B,well he amuses me either i m mad or else he is and i m inclined to think it s the latter one more fuss through with you charlotte many thanks i think though that this is the last my admirer will hardly trouble me again
p00070_B,00070,B,no church for me thank you
p00071_B,00071,B,certainly not there would be no difficulty whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over i have been frightened of him but now i am not one little bit

p00078_B,00078,B,i know i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable however what s done s done you have put me in a most awkward position how am i to get out of it he must that man must have such a setting down that he won t forget and who s to give it him i can t tell mother now owing to you nor cecil charlotte owing to you i am caught up every way i think i shall go mad i have no one to help me that s why i ve sent for you what s wanted is a man with a whip yes but it s no good agreeing what s to be done we women go maundering on what does a girl do when she comes across a cad
p00079_B,00079,B,charlotte here s an idea what if we popped off to rome to morrow straight to the vyses hotel for i do know what i want i m sick of florence no you said you d go to the ends of the earth do do
p00080_B,00080,B,signora bertolini would be upset
p00081_B,00081,B,but charlotte you know what happened then i want to be truthful it is so hard to be absolutely truthful
p00082_B,00082,B,about that dreadful afternoon in february
p00083_B,00083,B,she will make us pay for a whole week s pension
p00084_B,00084,B,let s leave it all till mother comes back

p00089_B,00089,B,told her what
p00090_B,00090,B,i have been a failure failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster
p00091_B,00091,B,how do you do mr beebe i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peter s that very cold easter
p00092_B,00092,B,yes but won t you tell me now what you would have done
p00093_B,00093,B,i did just happen when i had tea with her at rome in the course of conversation
p00094_B,00094,B,my good lucia i am all at sea i know nothing about it whatever
p00095_B,00095,B,we must face that
p00096_B,00096,B,no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts please please i know i am a sad spoil sport but it would make me wretched i should practically be robbing the one who lost
p00097_B,00097,B,i trust not one would always pray against that
p00098_B,00098,B,how are you going to stop him talking about it
p00099_B,00099,B,but you tell her everything
p00100_B,00100,B,the train to rome
p00101_B,00101,B,far worse mr eager does not like eleanor she knows it herself the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him where things might lead to whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr eager or mr eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogether which they could scarcely do but in any case we must be prepared it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind a one horse carriage would do for us yet how difficult it is
p00102_B,00102,B,and then
p00103_B,00103,B,funny girl how you do remind me of your mother i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe
p00104_B,00104,B,and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence
p00105_B,00105,B,i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times
p00106_B,00106,B,i always said he was a cad dear give me credit for that at all events from the very first moment when he said his father was having a bath
p00107_B,00107,B,willingly would i move heaven and earth
p00108_B,00108,B,do not cry dearest take your time
p00109_B,00109,B,we must think of every possibility
p00110_B,00110,B,never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00111_B,00111,B,poor lucy i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go
p00112_B,00112,B,i die for it
p00113_B,00113,B,what do you think about it
p00114_B,00114,B,at eight
p00115_B,00115,B,oh lucy i shall never forgive myself never to my dying day fancy if your prospects
p00116_B,00116,B,oh not that way back we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria
p00117_B,00117,B,it is my fault it is a disaster she will never forgive me and rightly for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish
p00118_B,00118,B,very well dear you know best perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young ladies are certainly different
p00119_B,00119,B,once a cad always a cad
p00120_B,00120,B,any nook does for me but it does seem hard that you shouldn t have a view
p00121_B,00121,B,dear one moment we may not have this chance for a chat again have you seen the young one yet
p00122_B,00122,B,then never never never more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00123_B,00123,B,what does it mean
p00124_B,00124,B,our performer has changed her mind
p00125_B,00125,B,lucy dear
p00126_B,00126,B,mr eager will be offended it is your party
p00127_B,00127,B,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p00128_B,00128,B,for instance the driver i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth
p00129_B,00129,B,how dreadful how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source
p00130_B,00130,B,very well dear how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too look lucia oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party i feared you would repent you of your choice
p00131_B,00131,B,i will never forgive eleanor she has betrayed my confidence
p00132_B,00132,B,if that is so dear if the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish
p00133_B,00133,B,no dear i want to explain why it is that i have taken the largest room naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this
p00134_B,00134,B,and the news
p00135_B,00135,B,undoubtedly he was
p00136_B,00136,B,lucy do you mind doing it
p00137_B,00137,B,beautiful are not beauty and delicacy the same
p00138_B,00138,B,this meat has surely been used for soup
p00139_B,00139,B,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p00140_B,00140,B,come away from the window dear you will be seen from the road oh for a real man we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless there is mr eager but you do not trust him oh for your brother he is young but i know that his sister s insult would rouse in him a very lion thank god chivalry is not yet dead there are still left some men who can reverence woman it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try
p00141_B,00141,B,i insist on it your mother would never forgive me lucy
p00142_B,00142,B,when he insulted you how would you have replied
p00143_B,00143,B,naturally dear it is my affair
p00144_B,00144,B,to contradict it
p00145_B,00145,B,my dear girl no mr george emerson
p00146_B,00146,B,nothing dearest he knows nothing but he knows everything dearest had we better shall i it is dreadful to be entangled with low class people he saw it all
p00147_B,00147,B,in a book
p00148_B,00148,B,i dare not break your confidence there is something sacred in it unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her
p00149_B,00149,B,oh dear lucy i do hope florence isn t boring you speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow
p00150_B,00150,B,how do you propose to silence him
p00151_B,00151,B,but we fear him for you dear you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can be how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened
p00152_B,00152,B,when i was here for your sake if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her
p00153_B,00153,B,my dear lucia
p00154_B,00154,B,you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too i know well how much i vex you at every turn
p00155_B,00155,B,or perhaps old mr emerson knows in fact he is certain to know
p00156_B,00156,B,it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle
p00157_B,00157,B,well it isn t everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it oh one oughtn t to laugh really it might have been very serious but you were so sensible and brave so unlike the girls of my day
p00158_B,00158,B,what would have happened if i hadn t arrived
p00159_B,00159,B,you must have it
p00160_B,00160,B,what line is he taking up
p00161_B,00161,B,i wish one word with you in the drawing room mr emerson please good night mr emerson
p00162_B,00162,B,ah but yes i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped i might have known it would not do you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you i am too uninteresting and old fashioned only fit to pack and unpack your things
p00163_B,00163,B,once a cad always a cad that is my poor opinion
p00164_B,00164,B,i too intend to judge him charitably but unfortunately i have met the type before they seldom keep their exploits to themselves
p00165_B,00165,B,oh you droll person pray what would become of your drive in the hills
p00166_B,00166,B,i expect she will however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel isn t afternoon tea given there for nothing
p00167_B,00167,B,don t be troubled dearest wait till you are calmer we will talk it over before bed time in my room
p00168_B,00168,B,oh lucy dearest girl she hasn t put that in her book
p00169_B,00169,B,dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me
p00170_B,00170,B,lucy lucy what a nuisance i am
p00171_B,00171,B,how could you think she was defending them
p00172_B,00172,B,what happened
p00173_B,00173,B,a view oh a view how delightful a view is
p00174_B,00174,B,thank you very much indeed that is out of the question
p00175_B,00175,B,go mr eager don t ask our driver our driver is no help go and support poor mr beebe he is nearly demented
p00176_B,00176,B,this is my son his name s george he has a view too
p00177_B,00177,B,so you ought a baby is worth a dozen saints and my baby s worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell in hell he s unhappy
p00178_B,00178,B,i suppose that mr vyse is going with you i hope it isn t because george spoke that you are both going
p00179_B,00179,B,why will he look at that fresco i saw nothing in it
p00180_B,00180,B,so george says he says that the miss alans must go to the wall yet it does seem so unkind
p00181_B,00181,B,i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he can t he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you i am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened
p00182_B,00182,B,the old trouble things won t fit
p00183_B,00183,B,but you are and there s a look of george about you and what were you saying about going abroad greece greece but you were to be married this year i thought
p00184_B,00184,B,poor girl poor girl
p00185_B,00185,B,but you do remember it
p00186_B,00186,B,but why should they when you have deceived them
p00187_B,00187,B,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p00188_B,00188,B,how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is
p00189_B,00189,B,certainly you can we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen
p00190_B,00190,B,especially as he has gone under
p00191_B,00191,B,as his mother did
p00192_B,00192,B,you are leaving him you are leaving the man you love
p00193_B,00193,B,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p00194_B,00194,B,but mr eager he came when i was out and acted according to his principles i don t blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it
p00195_B,00195,B,how good everyone is and look at mr beebe housing me came over this morning and heard i was going here i am so comfortable with a fire
p00196_B,00196,B,he was not baptized i did hold firm my boy shall go back to the earth untouched oh last sunday george last sunday no not ill just gone under he is never ill but he is his mother s son her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live it was always touch and go he will live but he will not think it worth while to live he will never think anything worth while you remember that church at florence after you left florence horrible then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better you saw him bathing
p00197_B,00197,B,i only was told that he loved you last sunday i never could judge behaviour i i suppose he has
p00198_B,00198,B,but you are you re shocked but i mean to shock you it s the only hope at times i can reach you no other way you must marry or your life will be wasted you have gone too far to retreat i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry i know that with george you will find them and that you love him then be his wife he is already part of you though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die it isn t possible to love and to part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ah for a little directness to liberate the soul your soul dear lucy i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round but we have souls i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours i cannot bear it it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell what nonsense i have talked how abstract and remote and i have made you cry dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love marry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made then lucy
p00199_B,00199,B,the things of the universe it is quite true they don t
p00200_B,00200,B,not abominably he only tried when he should not have tried you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love do not go out of george s life saying he is abominable
p00201_B,00201,B,why miss honeychurch why my dear i am worried about you it seems to me that you are in a muddle take an old man s word there s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful it is on my muddles that i look back with horror on the things that i might have avoided we can help one another but little i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren t do you remember before when you refused the room with the view those were muddles little but ominous and i am fearing that you are in one now don t trust me miss honeychurch though life is very glorious it is difficult wrote a friend of mine i think he puts it well man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along especially the function of love that s it that s what i mean you love george but you do you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it you won t marry the other man for his sake
p00202_B,00202,B,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p00203_B,00203,B,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p00204_B,00204,B,then there came something about a novel i didn t follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old ah well one must have failures george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms he can t bear to be about here and i must be where he is
p00205_B,00205,B,all the way to greece to greece
p00206_B,00206,B,i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george no it was wrong of george to try we have pushed our beliefs too far i fancy that we deserve sorrow
p00207_B,00207,B,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p00208_B,00208,B,when i wouldn t have george baptized and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round she thought it a judgement oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents oh horrible worst of all worse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again a judgement and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church is it possible miss honeychurch shall we slip back into the darkness for ever
p00209_B,00209,B,gone under naturally
p00210_B,00210,B,miss honeychurch you do sound tired
p00211_B,00211,B,why shouldn t you
p00212_B,00212,B,there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world
p00213_B,00213,B,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p00214_B,00214,B,perhaps he is i don t remember
p00215_B,00215,B,he will not come back
p00216_B,00216,B,it happened like this if it happened at all i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here
p00217_B,00217,B,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p00218_B,00218,B,i i ll come up to tennis if i can manage it
p00219_B,00219,B,some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up it did happen like that if it happened at all
p00220_B,00220,B,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p00221_B,00221,B,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p00222_B,00222,B,poor young man
p00223_B,00223,B,oh lucia come back here oh what an awful man
p00224_B,00224,B,has italy filled you with the fever of travel perhaps george emerson is right he says that
p00225_B,00225,B,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p00226_B,00226,B,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p00227_B,00227,B,i suspected it was unscholarly it s so beautiful
p00228_B,00228,B,no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling
p00229_B,00229,B,of course
p00230_B,00230,B,i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it
p00231_B,00231,B,miss lavish has led your cousin astray she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe
p00232_B,00232,B,oh rubbish miss honeychurch
p00233_B,00233,B,i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast
p00234_B,00234,B,why not
p00235_B,00235,B,i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise
p00236_B,00236,B,i have had an absurd letter from miss alan that was really what brought me over i thought it might amuse you all
p00237_B,00237,B,she oughtn t really to go at all and she knows it i put it down to too much beethoven
p00238_B,00238,B,it will be a novel dealing with modern italy let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know
p00239_B,00239,B,i am very sorry for that
p00240_B,00240,B,i needn t say that it will go no further
p00241_B,00241,B,they do say so
p00242_B,00242,B,i am more grieved than i can possibly express it is lamentable lamentable incredible
p00243_B,00243,B,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p00244_B,00244,B,did you tell mr emerson about greece
p00245_B,00245,B,next week i gather
p00246_B,00246,B,yes he is waking up
p00247_B,00247,B,would your mother spare you again so soon you have scarcely been home three months
p00248_B,00248,B,doesn t mrs honeychurch like music
p00249_B,00249,B,you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel
p00250_B,00250,B,no of course i ll see how are the miss alans
p00251_B,00251,B,no he didn t
p00252_B,00252,B,the emersons who were at florence do you mean no i don t suppose it will prove to be them it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyse s oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people the queerest people for our part we liked them didn t we
p00253_B,00253,B,i am afraid it has been a bothersome business
p00254_B,00254,B,but they really are coming now i wrote to miss teresa a few days ago she was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably they are coming i heard from them this morning
p00255_B,00255,B,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p00256_B,00256,B,the two ladies at all events have made it up
p00257_B,00257,B,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p00258_B,00258,B,come along tea tea tea
p00259_B,00259,B,still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you
p00260_B,00260,B,if you ll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing
p00261_B,00261,B,no i didn t suppose you would care to much how delicate those sonatas are miss honeychurch
p00262_B,00262,B,don t you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans now miss honeychurch go back keep warm i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling
p00263_B,00263,B,it s a beautiful song and a wise one go on
p00264_B,00264,B,with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe i didn t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa
p00265_B,00265,B,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p00266_B,00266,B,whatever happened
p00267_B,00267,B,but i must go somewhere i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing i must and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring you all think much too highly of me i wish you weren t so kind
p00268_B,00268,B,miss lavish is so original is it true that miss lavish is writing a book
p00269_B,00269,B,very well thank you
p00270_B,00270,B,and freddy minds
p00271_B,00271,B,i i did
p00272_B,00272,B,how delightful going abroad when do they start
p00273_B,00273,B,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish
p00274_B,00274,B,she must spare me i simply must go away i have to don t you see that i have to go away i didn t realize at the time and of course i want to see constantinople so particularly
p00275_B,00275,B,oh he did
p00276_B,00276,B,i don t think i will thank you
p00277_B,00277,B,no not at all cecil was very kind indeed only i had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a little it was that he is so masterful i found that he wouldn t let me go my own way he would improve me in places where i can t be improved cecil won t let a woman decide for herself in fact he daren t what nonsense i do talk but that is the kind of thing
p00278_B,00278,B,poor charlotte will be sopped
p00279_B,00279,B,mother charlotte cecil freddy you
p00280_B,00280,B,she doesn t mind it but she doesn t like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it she thinks i can t make out once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any one s she has never got over it of course i didn t mean that i played well i only meant
p00281_B,00281,B,because i do hope he won t go gossiping oh do tell me more about the miss alans how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad
p00282_B,00282,B,oh delightful i wish they d take me
p00283_B,00283,B,he is not going i made a slip mr vyse does stop behind in england
p00284_B,00284,B,so i hoped other people would think but they don t seem to
p00285_B,00285,B,oh that s nothing i assure you cissie villa s nothing to me i would give anything to go with them
p00286_B,00286,B,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p00287_B,00287,B,so does mother mother minds dreadfully
p00288_B,00288,B,i think so i ll see
p00289_B,00289,B,oh how glad i am the name of our house is windy corner there is mother and me generally and my brother though it s not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean
p00290_B,00290,B,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p00291_B,00291,B,oh not italy but constantinople i have always longed to go to constantinople constantinople is practically asia isn t it
p00292_B,00292,B,yes yes i knew you d understand yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down
p00293_B,00293,B,he seems in better spirits he laughs more
p00294_B,00294,B,did freddy say whether he was driving straight back
p00295_B,00295,B,boys are so odd
p00296_B,00296,B,what is it about
p00297_B,00297,B,mr beebe i have misled you i have misled myself
p00298_B,00298,B,it isn t very good i forget why harmony or something
p00299_B,00299,B,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p00300_B,00300,B,one is very thankful that she has such a resource she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be i know all about it the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak
p00301_B,00301,B,quite so
p00302_B,00302,B,i hardly know george for he hasn t learnt to talk yet he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains of course he has all his father s mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist
p00303_B,00303,B,i am eating it thank you and enjoying it
p00304_B,00304,B,not at all i never suggested that
p00305_B,00305,B,of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind
p00306_B,00306,B,i wonder
p00307_B,00307,B,exactly have you heard from any bertolini people lately i believe you keep up with miss lavish it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one another s lives two three four six of us no eight i had forgotten the emersons have kept more or less in touch we must really give the signora a testimonial we shan t have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on the darkness last night was appalling i have been thinking miss bartlett and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion nothing about the past i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin s credit she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her but the future seriously what do you think of this greek plan i don t know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career it s all i can t explain it s wrong i can t see the point of it myself
p00308_B,00308,B,he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth
p00309_B,00309,B,we are friendly as one is in pensions
p00310_B,00310,B,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p00311_B,00311,B,let us keep to the future though i want your advice
p00312_B,00312,B,really now why
p00313_B,00313,B,you acted very naturally all the same i don t think much harm would have come of accepting
p00314_B,00314,B,i know but it seems so odd so unlike her so i was going to say selfish
p00315_B,00315,B,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p00316_B,00316,B,no mr beebe you are wrong the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato
p00317_B,00317,B,how tired one gets oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here
p00318_B,00318,B,that lady looks so clever we are in luck
p00319_B,00319,B,eleanor be quiet hush they ll hear the emersons
p00320_B,00320,B,oh lucy you ought to be with mr eager i m sure
p00321_B,00321,B,oh you wicked woman i am sure you are thinking of the emersons
p00322_B,00322,B,we are most grateful to you the first evening means so much when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d heure do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner
p00323_B,00323,B,lucy without a moment s doubt lucy the ground will do for me really i have not had rheumatism for years if i do feel it coming on i shall stand imagine your mother s feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen here we are all settled delightfully even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown sit down dear you are too unselfish you don t assert yourself enough now don t be alarmed this isn t a cold it s the tiniest cough and i have had it three days it s nothing to do with sitting here at all
p00324_B,00324,B,she is my idea of a really clever woman that last remark struck me as so particularly true it should be a most pathetic novel
p00325_B,00325,B,what is the heroine s name
p00326_B,00326,B,but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness
p00327_B,00327,B,i know yet freddy ought not to have told even you one cannot be too careful
p00328_B,00328,B,she wanted to leave windy corner
p00329_B,00329,B,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p00330_B,00330,B,my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally
p00331_B,00331,B,it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment
p00332_B,00332,B,then i will say no more i am as it were the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing his manner was somewhat unfortunate i hope i acted for the best
p00333_B,00333,B,it is natural surely after such painful scenes that she should desire a change
p00334_B,00334,B,very well i for one will help her to go to greece will you it is absolutely necessary i know i know she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes i trust that the servants know nothing afterwards but i may have said too much already only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone if you help we may succeed otherwise
p00335_B,00335,B,lucy can always play
p00336_B,00336,B,it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street it would be death to gossip about mr vyse s dismissal at the present moment
p00337_B,00337,B,oh you relieve me so you think i ought to have accepted their offer you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious
p00338_B,00338,B,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p00339_B,00339,B,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p00340_B,00340,B,you may well ask that why greece what is it minnie dear jam why not tunbridge wells oh mr beebe i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning i cannot help her i will say no more perhaps i have already said too much i am not to talk i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused
p00341_B,00341,B,i do implore absolute secrecy a chance word to a chattering friend and
p00342_B,00342,B,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p00343_B,00343,B,there i cannot agree with you in it i spy lucy s salvation
p00344_B,00344,B,i think he was meaning to be kind
p00345_B,00345,B,yet our rooms smell we dread going to bed
p00346_B,00346,B,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p00347_B,00347,B,i did not miss lavish told me
p00348_B,00348,B,national gallery
p00349_B,00349,B,it is fate that i am here but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy
p00350_B,00350,B,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p00351_B,00351,B,it is i have reflected it is fate everything is fate we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fate flung together drawn apart the twelve winds blow us we settle nothing
p00352_B,00352,B,is it a very nice smell
p00353_B,00353,B,very well indeed
p00354_B,00354,B,why she rents a field of us how funny
p00355_B,00355,B,we sat opposite them at dinner last night they have given us their rooms they were so very kind
p00356_B,00356,B,what would you ask us
p00357_B,00357,B,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p00358_B,00358,B,no in the surrey hills about five miles from dorking looking over the weald
p00359_B,00359,B,indeed i m not we are radicals too out and out my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland
p00360_B,00360,B,hardly any only thirty acres just the garden all downhill and some fields
p00361_B,00361,B,oh no i am here as a tourist
p00362_B,00362,B,oh please if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp
p00363_B,00363,B,look at their figures they walk through my italy like a pair of cows it s very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldn t pass it
p00364_B,00364,B,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p00365_B,00365,B,and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist
p00366_B,00366,B,one doesn t come to italy for niceness one comes for life buon giorno buon giorno look at that adorable wine cart how the driver stares at us dear simple soul buon giorno take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors that is the true democracy though i am a real radical as well there now you re shocked
p00367_B,00367,B,oh you have property in surrey
p00368_B,00368,B,it is i who am sorry literary hacks are shameless creatures i believe there s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn t pry
p00369_B,00369,B,there goes my local colour box i must have a word with him
p00370_B,00370,B,miss honeychurch listening pouf wouf you naughty girl go away

p00434_B,00434,B,silly boy he thinks he s being dignified he knew we should go off in the spring he has known it for six months that if mother wouldn t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement ridiculous boy
p00435_B,00435,B,mr emerson
p00436_B,00436,B,weren t you pleased no wonder the novel s bad i never liked miss lavish but i suppose one ought to read it as one s met her

p00438_B,00438,B,perfectly well absolutely well
p00439_B,00439,B,thank you so much and would you well thank you so much how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life

p00442_B,00442,B,of course i m not
p00443_B,00443,B,no don t be rude to him mr eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte how cruel she would be to a man like that
p00444_B,00444,B,oh good gracious me where where
p00445_B,00445,B,i have behaved ridiculously i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me
p00446_B,00446,B,but this room reminds me of charlotte how horrible to grow old in charlotte s way to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn t have heard your father was in the house for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense you couldn t have made me when i am very happy i remember on how little it all hangs if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever
p00447_B,00447,B,mr emerson
p00448_B,00448,B,it is impossible no it is just possible
p00449_B,00449,B,why you did
p00450_B,00450,B,oh bother charlotte what can such people be made of
p00451_B,00451,B,just a line from freddy
p00452_B,00452,B,i bought some photographs at alinari s i must have dropped them out there in the square would you add to your kindness by fetching them
p00453_B,00453,B,no of course not really
p00454_B,00454,B,you go down to the others charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants where s mother
p00455_B,00455,B,oh stop now you have come
p00456_B,00456,B,san miniato i ll just finish your sock
p00457_B,00457,B,i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour
p00458_B,00458,B,well i owe you a thousand apologies
p00459_B,00459,B,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p00460_B,00460,B,go please i do not want to call in mr vyse
p00461_B,00461,B,what do you mean
p00462_B,00462,B,i hope we all try
p00463_B,00463,B,he will never forgive us i mean he will never be interested in us again i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner i wish he hadn t but if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run
p00464_B,00464,B,i don t i shall probably want to live
p00465_B,00465,B,i want to ask you something before we go in
p00466_B,00466,B,because they re all alike because all that matters in them is distance and air
p00467_B,00467,B,you don t mean you don t mean that you are going to marry that man
p00468_B,00468,B,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p00469_B,00469,B,what does he say
p00470_B,00470,B,now kiss me here then here lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows
p00471_B,00471,B,no you aren t you d go openly if you were
p00472_B,00472,B,things i didn t want
p00473_B,00473,B,then let us come home there s no point in our stopping
p00474_B,00474,B,because we think it improves our characters but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened
p00475_B,00475,B,what photographs
p00476_B,00476,B,no he isn t well
p00477_B,00477,B,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p00478_B,00478,B,i didn t know what to do with them they were covered with blood there i m glad i ve told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them they ve gone i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the sea i don t know i may just mean that they frightened me for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled it isn t exactly that a man has died it has happened and i mean to find out what it is
p00479_B,00479,B,of course i do i saw her the day i arrived at summer street it was she who told me that you lived here
p00480_B,00480,B,same stuff as parsons are made of
p00481_B,00481,B,do you mind being beaten
p00482_B,00482,B,is it this is this possible i ll put a marvel to you that your cousin has always hoped that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like this of course very far down that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped i can t explain her any other way can you look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable the sight of us haunted her or she couldn t have described us as she did to her friend there are details it burnt i read the book afterwards she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy we can never make friends with her or thank her but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad
p00483_B,00483,B,oh all right
p00484_B,00484,B,but she did know she did see my father surely he said so
p00485_B,00485,B,miss honeychurch you sit still you aren t fit to go home alone
p00486_B,00486,B,you and are you tired
p00487_B,00487,B,or did she mean it
p00488_B,00488,B,you fainted
p00489_B,00489,B,you didn t attend
p00490_B,00490,B,perhaps well i acted the truth the only thing i did do and you came back to me so possibly you know nonsense with that sock
p00491_B,00491,B,but i can t
p00492_B,00492,B,i m afraid i don t
p00493_B,00493,B,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p00494_B,00494,B,how are you now
p00495_B,00495,B,my mother i was meaning
p00496_B,00496,B,i nearly fainted myself
p00497_B,00497,B,you may well wish that
p00498_B,00498,B,i never notice much difference in views
p00499_B,00499,B,why shouldn t i be a baby
p00500_B,00500,B,look at the lights going over the bridge
p00501_B,00501,B,then i don t fetch your photographs
p00502_B,00502,B,you cannot live with vyse he s only for an acquaintance he is for society and cultivated talk he should know no one intimately least of all a woman have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired
p00503_B,00503,B,no but have you ever he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things books pictures but kill when they come to people that s why i ll speak out through all this muddle even now it s shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person i would never have let myself go but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour that is the man all over playing tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no cecil all over again he daren t let a woman decide he s the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years every moment of his life he s forming you telling you what s charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon therefore not because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control i m not ashamed i don t apologize but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly but therefore therefore i settled to fight him
p00504_B,00504,B,i never said i was
p00505_B,00505,B,i shall want to live i say
p00506_B,00506,B,your behaviour oh yes all right all right
p00507_B,00507,B,why shouldn t i laugh what s there to cry at kiss me here any letters
p00508_B,00508,B,yes i have i m the same kind of brute at bottom this desire to govern a woman it lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden but i do love you surely in a better way than he does
p00509_B,00509,B,none why
p00510_B,00510,B,in the nave
p00511_B,00511,B,my father saw her and i prefer his word he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett a few minutes before you came in she was turning to go as he woke up he didn t speak to her it s clear that she knew then why did she risk the meeting she knew he was there and yet she went to church
p00512_B,00512,B,you will never go up you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives
p00513_B,00513,B,but we have spoilt the pleasure of i don t know how many people they won t come back
p00514_B,00514,B,george don t go george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon
p00515_B,00515,B,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p00516_B,00516,B,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p00517_B,00517,B,stop there s plenty of room for us all stop
p00518_B,00518,B,it is not victory it is defeat you have parted two people who were happy we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it we have no rights over his soul
p00519_B,00519,B,the point is we have warred with it look fifty miles of spring and we ve come up to admire them do you suppose there s any difference between spring in nature and spring in man but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both
p00520_B,00520,B,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p00521_B,00521,B,cousin of one of my parishioners i do not consider her choice of a piece happy beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs
p00522_B,00522,B,my sermon why ever did she listen to it
p00523_B,00523,B,introduce me
p00524_B,00524,B,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p00525_B,00525,B,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable
p00526_B,00526,B,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p00527_B,00527,B,italians dear you know
p00528_B,00528,B,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p00529_B,00529,B,what was that
p00530_B,00530,B,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p00531_B,00531,B,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p00532_B,00532,B,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p00533_B,00533,B,it was a novel and i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink she said but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour this novel is to be about modern italy the other was historical but that she could not start till she had an idea first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came here this must on no account get round and so cheerful through it all i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them all the same she is a little too i hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived i don t know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely
p00534_B,00534,B,then sit you down observe my foresight
p00535_B,00535,B,aha miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning but perhaps you would rather not
p00536_B,00536,B,i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people of course this is the barest outline there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist
p00537_B,00537,B,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p00538_B,00538,B,ah not for me for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time
p00539_B,00539,B,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p00540_B,00540,B,ignore him
p00541_B,00541,B,he is not he made an advantageous marriage
p00542_B,00542,B,dead miss bartlett dead i wonder yes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me he was in my london parish long ago the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him let him beware that he does not get more than a snub
p00543_B,00543,B,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p00544_B,00544,B,so you were here alone miss honeychurch
p00545_B,00545,B,so i saw were you indeed andate via sono occupato i am about to venture a suggestion would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week a drive in the hills we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour s ramble on the hillside the view thence of florence is most beautiful far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures that man had a decided feeling for landscape decidedly but who looks at it to day ah the world is too much for us so we shall be a partie carree in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity andate via andate presto presto ah the town beautiful as it is it is the town this very square so i am told witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration portentous and humiliating
p00546_B,00546,B,generally one has only sympathy for their success the desire for education and for social advance in these things there is something not wholly vile there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence little as they would make of it
p00547_B,00547,B,to speak plainly it is i will say no more
p00548_B,00548,B,and how came we to have you here
p00549_B,00549,B,we were chatting to miss lavish
p00550_B,00550,B,humiliating indeed miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened she can hardly bear to speak of it
p00551_B,00551,B,willingly would i purchase
p00552_B,00552,B,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p00553_B,00553,B,how wonderfully people rise in these days

p00565_B,00565,B,you have said very little
p00566_B,00566,B,that must have saved you much you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press this man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views this is too much
p00567_B,00567,B,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p00568_B,00568,B,oh indeed are you indeed if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little handed about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl you know the american girl in punch who says and the father replies there s travelling for you ha ha ha
p00569_B,00569,B,and you and your friend
p00570_B,00570,B,it was my intention to say very little murder if you want to know that man murdered his wife
p00571_B,00571,B,even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking courage courage and faith
p00572_B,00572,B,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p00573_B,00573,B,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day
p00574_B,00574,B,surely no
p00575_B,00575,B,quite so now the english colony at florence miss honeychurch and it is of considerable size though of course not all equally a few are here for trade for example but the greater part are students lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left no you can only see it if you stand no do not stand you will fall she is very proud of that thick hedge inside perfect seclusion one might have gone back six hundred years some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not
p00576_B,00576,B,doubtless you know her monographs in the series of mediaeval byways he is working at gemistus pletho sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i think think i think how little they think what lies so near them
p00577_B,00577,B,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p00578_B,00578,B,va bene signore va bene va bene she is my sister
p00579_B,00579,B,most certainly i would let them be but i dare say i shall receive scant support i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life this is what i call an adventure
p00580_B,00580,B,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature
p00581_B,00581,B,he was not driving us well he jolted us
p00582_B,00582,B,the lord knows possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet he wrote a line so i heard yesterday which runs like this don t go fighting against the spring
p00583_B,00583,B,that i deny it was as restful as sleeping aha he is jolting us now can you wonder he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified and if i were superstitious i d be frightened of the girl too it doesn t do to injure young people have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici
p00584_B,00584,B,typical behaviour in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down
p00585_B,00585,B,would render a correct meaning
p00586_B,00586,B,charlotte dear charlotte kiss me kiss me again only you can understand me you warned me to be careful and i i thought i was developing

p00589_B,00589,B,all the way he will be hours
p00590_B,00590,B,apparently i told him it was unwise
p00591_B,00591,B,courage miss honeychurch courage and faith if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me
p00592_B,00592,B,george ask your driver which way george went the boy may lose his way he may be killed

p00600_B,00600,B,i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you
p00601_B,00601,B,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p00602_B,00602,B,the garden of eden which you place in the past is really yet to come we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies in this not in other things we men are ahead we despise the body less than women do but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden
p00603_B,00603,B,how very odd of him

p00605_B,00605,B,i said i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth when it comes to the point he can t get on without me

p00616_B,00616,B,i trust they are the right sort of person all right lucy i see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother s a snob but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and it s affectation to pretend there isn t
p00617_B,00617,B,mr beebe i don t see how mr beebe comes in
p00618_B,00618,B,no i shall not keep quiet you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house
p00619_B,00619,B,oh cecil oh cecil do tell me

p00623_B,00623,B,for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then i think things are coming to a head
p00624_B,00624,B,i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more
p00625_B,00625,B,hush dear
p00626_B,00626,B,freddy you must come there they still are
p00627_B,00627,B,then the whole thing runs
p00628_B,00628,B,you never can dear but i can you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties will this do then i put in at the top i must write the letter out again i said that because i didn t want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maid s dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light she keeps that flat abominably
p00629_B,00629,B,you what do you mean
p00630_B,00630,B,i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlotte s how is she
p00631_B,00631,B,freddy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00632_B,00632,B,ridiculous child you think you re so holy and truthful but really it s only abominable conceit do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say i hope he boxed your ears how dare you say no
p00633_B,00633,B,i know dear she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return
p00634_B,00634,B,why so why shouldn t my permission be asked
p00635_B,00635,B,so am i
p00636_B,00636,B,nor me
p00637_B,00637,B,and me i ve swallowed one i ve swallowed a pollywog it wriggleth in my tummy i shall die emerson you beast you ve got on my bags
p00638_B,00638,B,i said to cecil
p00639_B,00639,B,so would i
p00640_B,00640,B,i answered no there fly into a stew i can t help it had to say it i had to say no he ought never to have asked me
p00641_B,00641,B,i don t know whether they re any emersons
p00642_B,00642,B,the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully not content with permission which i did give that is to say i said well not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasn t off my head with joy he practically put it like this wasn t it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her and he would have an answer he said it would strengthen his hand
p00643_B,00643,B,oh yes and you will be satisfied too for they re friends of cecil so you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety
p00644_B,00644,B,cross it out too
p00645_B,00645,B,yes mother you told me a jolly good letter
p00646_B,00646,B,i feel never mind
p00647_B,00647,B,oh don t go
p00648_B,00648,B,you know mr beebe s funny way when you never quite know what he means he said i was very cute i asked him what he meant he said i couldn t make him say any more but it set me thinking since cecil has come after lucy he hasn t been so pleasant at least i can t explain
p00649_B,00649,B,not a bit i only let out i didn t like him i don t hate him but i don t like him what i mind is that he ll tell lucy
p00650_B,00650,B,but look at lucy complaining of saturn and all the time s got the beautiful white devil in her hand ready to plug it in that s right minnie go for her get her over the shins with the racquet get her over the shins
p00651_B,00651,B,the bother is this
p00652_B,00652,B,i liked him till just now i suppose it s having him spoiling lucy s first week at home and it s also something that mr beebe said not knowing
p00653_B,00653,B,look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellow s got to dry and if another fellow
p00654_B,00654,B,time they did
p00655_B,00655,B,it s his third go isn t it
p00656_B,00656,B,i don t see you ought to go peeping like that
p00657_B,00657,B,look out
p00658_B,00658,B,suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country
p00659_B,00659,B,he asked me for my permission also
p00660_B,00660,B,i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right
p00661_B,00661,B,i didn t mean to be unkind but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy i don t know how girls manage things but she can t have said properly before or she wouldn t have to say it again now over the whole thing i can t explain i do feel so uncomfortable
p00662_B,00662,B,oh do keep quiet mother i had to say no when i couldn t say yes i tried to laugh as if i didn t mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right but i feel my foot s in it oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work
p00663_B,00663,B,isn t mr eager a parson of the cultured type
p00664_B,00664,B,come this way immediately
p00665_B,00665,B,to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous
p00666_B,00666,B,i promessi sposi she has accepted me
p00667_B,00667,B,we were speaking of motives
p00668_B,00668,B,mrs honeychurch what if we two walk home and leave you
p00669_B,00669,B,i count myself a lucky person when i m in london i feel i could never live out of it when i m in the country i feel the same about the country after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best it s true that in nine cases out of ten they don t seem to notice anything the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town do you feel that mrs honeychurch
p00670_B,00670,B,no business of ours
p00671_B,00671,B,would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it and i d stop here and tell my mother
p00672_B,00672,B,i hope so
p00673_B,00673,B,a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless
p00674_B,00674,B,this way please mrs honeychurch this way
p00675_B,00675,B,i say lucy
p00676_B,00676,B,miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett

p00678_B,00678,B,oh poor mr beebe was that his waistcoat we left in the path cecil mr beebe s waistcoat
p00679_B,00679,B,i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond
p00680_B,00680,B,i am so glad welcome as one of the family this is indeed a joyous day i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy
p00681_B,00681,B,my dear cecil look here this is me that s windy corner the rest of the pattern is the other people motives are all very well but the fence comes here
p00682_B,00682,B,how well did you know them at the bertolini
p00683_B,00683,B,this isn t very kind of you two you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old
p00684_B,00684,B,steady on
p00685_B,00685,B,we go with lucy
p00686_B,00686,B,i didn t mean the egg was well boiled because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i don t care for eggs i only meant how jolly kind she seemed
p00687_B,00687,B,may me and lucy get down from our chairs we don t want no dessert
p00688_B,00688,B,yes you go with lucy
p00689_B,00689,B,i ve come for tea mr vyse do you suppose that i shall get it
p00690_B,00690,B,grazie tante
p00691_B,00691,B,i am glad that you approve i daren t face the healthy person for example freddy honeychurch
p00692_B,00692,B,i have no profession it is another example of my decadence my attitude quite an indefensible one is that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i don t care a straw about but somehow i ve not been able to begin
p00693_B,00693,B,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval
p00694_B,00694,B,i suppose anne never told them you were here in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet the faults of mary i forget the faults of mary but they are very grave shall we look in the garden
p00695_B,00695,B,in what way
p00696_B,00696,B,the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small the faults of freddy
p00697_B,00697,B,i should say so food is the thing one does get here don t sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it
p00698_B,00698,B,it has broken now
p00699_B,00699,B,i meant that she is going to marry me
p00700_B,00700,B,she has none
p00701_B,00701,B,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes
p00702_B,00702,B,at present
p00703_B,00703,B,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance
p00704_B,00704,B,news i don t understand you news
p00705_B,00705,B,admirable the sort who has made england what she is
p00706_B,00706,B,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet
p00707_B,00707,B,has he indeed
p00708_B,00708,B,but the string never broke
p00709_B,00709,B,you are very fortunate it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure
p00710_B,00710,B,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be
p00711_B,00711,B,broken what do you mean
p00712_B,00712,B,ah he has too many no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable
p00713_B,00713,B,oh freddy s a good sort isn t he
p00714_B,00714,B,i know the faults of mary she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs
p00715_B,00715,B,i ve come for tea and for gossip isn t this news
p00716_B,00716,B,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me
p00717_B,00717,B,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her
p00718_B,00718,B,i quite agree at present she has none
p00719_B,00719,B,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad
p00720_B,00720,B,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession
p00721_B,00721,B,i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack
p00722_B,00722,B,where are the others i insist on extracting tea before evening service
p00723_B,00723,B,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you
p00724_B,00724,B,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks
p00725_B,00725,B,unpardonable question to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church i ll set mrs honeychurch after you
p00726_B,00726,B,no i mightn t have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall
p00727_B,00727,B,come for a walk with me you have worried them as much as they can stand mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may
p00728_B,00728,B,mrs honeychurch go to greece she must come up to the house and let s talk it over do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse
p00729_B,00729,B,she is playing the piano i didn t know that miss honeychurch sang too
p00730_B,00730,B,indeed i have mrs honeychurch i m going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally i m too shy i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother and now i want my tea
p00731_B,00731,B,it is terrible this havoc among the flowers
p00732_B,00732,B,you only asked for it just in time how dare you be serious at windy corner
p00733_B,00733,B,i shall hate those miss alans just because they re old and silly one s expected to say how sweet i hate their if ing and but ing and and ing and poor lucy serve her right worn to a shadow
p00734_B,00734,B,gracious alive whoever were those unfortunate people oh dears look away and poor mr beebe too whatever has happened
p00735_B,00735,B,it s a song that cecil gave her how odd girls are
p00736_B,00736,B,oh must you yes do not the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full already i m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it yes charlotte i don t want you do go there s nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it
p00737_B,00737,B,murdered his wife lucy don t desert us go on playing bumble puppy really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place that s the second murderer i ve heard of as being there whatever was charlotte doing to stop by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time
p00738_B,00738,B,mr beebe i m thankful simply thankful
p00739_B,00739,B,i don t see why greece is necessary but as you do i suppose it is all right it must be something i can t understand lucy let s tell her lucy

p00744_B,00744,B,i don t know i hate him i ve heard him lecture on giotto i hate him nothing can hide a petty nature i hate him
p00745_B,00745,B,inglese italianato
p00746_B,00746,B,i suppose so mother would it be
p00747_B,00747,B,we all have our limitations i suppose
p00748_B,00748,B,oh cecil i do i do i don t know what i should do without you
p00749_B,00749,B,i bathed here too till i was found out then there was a row
p00750_B,00750,B,it isn t fair cecil i blame you i blame you very much indeed you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense i consider it most disloyal of you
p00751_B,00751,B,a room
p00752_B,00752,B,yes with no view i fancy why not
p00753_B,00753,B,don t listen to him sir harry he s tiresome
p00754_B,00754,B,now a clergyman that i do hate a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr eager the english chaplain at florence he was truly insincere not merely the manner unfortunate he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things
p00755_B,00755,B,oh cecil whatever do you mean i have never felt anything of the sort you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person
p00756_B,00756,B,perhaps the road is more sensible as we re got up smart
p00757_B,00757,B,don t you like mr beebe
p00758_B,00758,B,it s impossible i don t want to make difficulties but it really isn t fair on the maids to fill up the house so
p00759_B,00759,B,one has to go through it i suppose they won t notice us so much next time
p00760_B,00760,B,cecil no it s not fair i ve probably met them before
p00761_B,00761,B,oh cecil whatever do you mean the sacred lake
p00762_B,00762,B,all that you say is quite true i wonder whether whether it matters so very much
p00763_B,00763,B,what cecil
p00764_B,00764,B,how tiresome couldn t you have escaped to tennis
p00765_B,00765,B,no more you have
p00766_B,00766,B,but cecil
p00767_B,00767,B,i can t remember why i suppose it comes out of some book it s only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and can t get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful then freddy used to bathe there he is very fond of it
p00768_B,00768,B,he isn t clever but really he is nice
p00769_B,00769,B,of course you may cecil you might before i can t run at you you know emerson was the name not harris
p00770_B,00770,B,oh cecil
p00771_B,00771,B,oh now and then
p00772_B,00772,B,there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife
p00773_B,00773,B,the old man s
p00774_B,00774,B,that old man i told you about the one mr eager was so unkind to
p00775_B,00775,B,do you know that you re right i do i must be a poetess after all when i think of you it s always as in a room how funny
p00776_B,00776,B,haven t i the wood then
p00777_B,00777,B,which way shall we go
p00778_B,00778,B,no you don t you don t know what the word means
p00779_B,00779,B,i have heard freddy has told us naughty cecil i suppose i must forgive you just think of all the trouble i took for nothing certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and i d rather have nice friends of yours but you oughtn t to tease one so
p00780_B,00780,B,yes i suppose we ought to be going
p00781_B,00781,B,i am so sorry that you were stranded
p00782_B,00782,B,i never said so i consider him far above the average i only denied
p00783_B,00783,B,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p00784_B,00784,B,no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life in london he would keep his place he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyone even your mother is taken in
p00785_B,00785,B,hear hear
p00786_B,00786,B,sometimes they are forced on us though
p00787_B,00787,B,i can t help it it would be wrong not to loathe that man
p00788_B,00788,B,who found you out
p00789_B,00789,B,not that but the congratulations it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment all those old women smirking
p00790_B,00790,B,it matters supremely sir harry is the essence of that garden party oh goodness how cross i feel how i do hope he ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa some woman so really vulgar that he ll notice it gentlefolks ugh with his bald head and retreating chin but let s forget him
p00791_B,00791,B,i d rather that you connected me with the open air
p00792_B,00792,B,perhaps he had
p00793_B,00793,B,he is the clever sort like myself
p00794_B,00794,B,poor girl lucy
p00795_B,00795,B,what sort of things
p00796_B,00796,B,i don t know that you aren t i connect you with a view a certain type of view why shouldn t you connect me with a room
p00797_B,00797,B,i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well
p00798_B,00798,B,i don t play tennis at least not in public the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato
p00799_B,00799,B,in the umbrian room absolute strangers they were admiring luca signorelli of course quite stupidly however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little they had been to italy
p00800_B,00800,B,why do you call it that
p00801_B,00801,B,i had got an idea i dare say wrongly that you feel more at home with me in a room
p00802_B,00802,B,lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before
p00803_B,00803,B,e un diavolo incarnato you know the proverb well i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them
p00804_B,00804,B,hitherto never not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me
p00805_B,00805,B,so you do love me little thing
p00806_B,00806,B,what old man
p00807_B,00807,B,then i ask you may i now
p00808_B,00808,B,are there two ways
p00809_B,00809,B,is it typical of country society
p00810_B,00810,B,let us take mrs honeychurch s advice and hate clergymen no more what s this place
p00811_B,00811,B,i d rather go through the wood why is it lucy that you always say the road do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged
p00812_B,00812,B,friends of mine but lucy the whole joke is to come come here do you know where i met these desirable tenants in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week
p00813_B,00813,B,now some beethoven
p00814_B,00814,B,in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage the father to live there the son to run down for week ends i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they weren t actual blackguards it was great sport and wrote to him making out
p00815_B,00815,B,perfectly fair anything is fair that punishes a snob that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long you ll agree with me there ought to be intermarriage all sorts of things i believe in democracy
p00816_B,00816,B,and you
p00817_B,00817,B,a drawing room pray with no view
p00818_B,00818,B,yes or at the most in a garden or on a road never in the real country like this
p00819_B,00819,B,no you don t
p00820_B,00820,B,what name
p00821_B,00821,B,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such
p00822_B,00822,B,cecil has told you to think so you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever no it is just the same thing everywhere
p00823_B,00823,B,not in that way at times i could wring her neck but not in that way no it is the same with cecil all over
p00824_B,00824,B,then if you re so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy
p00825_B,00825,B,but pick it up and don t stand idling there like a flamingo
p00826_B,00826,B,lucy you ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one s sentences did charlotte mention her boiler
p00827_B,00827,B,is it a thing or a person when freddy sings
p00828_B,00828,B,then depend upon it it is the boiler i know myself how water preys upon one s mind i would rather anything else even a misfortune with the meat
p00829_B,00829,B,oh rubbish if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better
p00830_B,00830,B,emerson freddy do you know what emersons they are
p00831_B,00831,B,oh i see dear poetry i tell you who has no as you call them and that s mr beebe
p00832_B,00832,B,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p00833_B,00833,B,perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether
p00834_B,00834,B,since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him whenever i speak he winces i see him lucy it is useless to contradict me no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember
p00835_B,00835,B,well i see the likeness the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters
p00836_B,00836,B,but why at all
p00837_B,00837,B,and you are right too greece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you
p00838_B,00838,B,minnie can sleep with you
p00839_B,00839,B,go and dress dear you ll be late
p00840_B,00840,B,oh that reminds me you never told me what charlotte said in her letter
p00841_B,00841,B,perhaps he s tired because otherwise because otherwise i cannot account for him
p00842_B,00842,B,come here old lady thank you for putting away my bonnet kiss me
p00843_B,00843,B,very well old lady stop the horse
p00844_B,00844,B,my goodness gracious me child you ll blow my head off whatever is there to shout over i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen
p00845_B,00845,B,didn t she say how she was how does she sound cheerful
p00846_B,00846,B,oh goodness how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett
p00847_B,00847,B,charlotte again my dear that s all her very words
p00848_B,00848,B,don t say and stop go
p00849_B,00849,B,plenty of society
p00850_B,00850,B,stop here s sir harry now we shall know sir harry pull those things down at once
p00851_B,00851,B,from your own account you told her as much
p00852_B,00852,B,then why didn t he leave the room why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone s pleasure
p00853_B,00853,B,very well take your independence and be gone rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear view and then share a flat with another girl
p00854_B,00854,B,nonsense it can
p00855_B,00855,B,there you go
p00856_B,00856,B,then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour
p00857_B,00857,B,surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour
p00858_B,00858,B,here s mr beebe
p00859_B,00859,B,i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic but i cannot see why you didn t tell your friends about cecil and be done with it there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant but why shouldn t it be everywhere in no time
p00860_B,00860,B,lucy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00861_B,00861,B,don t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings
p00862_B,00862,B,how s charlotte
p00863_B,00863,B,and mess with typewriters and latch keys and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police and call it a mission when no one wants you and call it duty when it means that you can t stand your own home and call it work when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them
p00864_B,00864,B,you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me i m so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work you ve got rid of cecil well and good and i m thankful he s gone though i did feel angry for the minute but why not announce it why this hushing up and tip toeing
p00865_B,00865,B,the truth is dear you don t like charlotte
p00866_B,00866,B,hush dear poor old man what was his name
p00867_B,00867,B,what rubbish and if you dislike charlotte so it s rather a pity you asked her to stop i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to
p00868_B,00868,B,thank you mother that doesn t matter a bit
p00869_B,00869,B,no i don t and no more does cecil she gets on our nerves you haven t seen her lately and don t realize how tiresome she can be though so good so please mother don t worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come
p00870_B,00870,B,she was a novelist
p00871_B,00871,B,yes i really can t stop i must dress too
p00872_B,00872,B,now mother i ve seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself
p00873_B,00873,B,i can t remember all charlotte s worries i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil
p00874_B,00874,B,i i see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtn t to but he does not mean to be uncivil he once explained it is the things that upset him he is easily upset by ugly things he is not uncivil to people
p00875_B,00875,B,half a minute would be nearer
p00876_B,00876,B,we weren t talking of real fences
p00877_B,00877,B,mother do come away oh for goodness sake do come
p00878_B,00878,B,cecil has a very high standard for people it s part of his ideals it is really that that makes him sometimes seem
p00879_B,00879,B,oh splendid oh thank you
p00880_B,00880,B,i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that
p00881_B,00881,B,by the by i never told you i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london
p00882_B,00882,B,i can t help it mother i don t like charlotte i admit it s horrid of me
p00883_B,00883,B,mr beebe knows my rude ways
p00884_B,00884,B,well if they are coming no minnie not saturn if they are coming sir harry will let them move in before the twenty ninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear one that doesn t count i told you not saturn
p00885_B,00885,B,i will bow i will not shake hands with him that will be just the proper thing
p00886_B,00886,B,i won t have her
p00887_B,00887,B,it s only for a few days
p00888_B,00888,B,oh yes i suppose so no not very cheerful i suppose
p00889_B,00889,B,hush mother people will hear you of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been you see i come into my money next year i ve seen the world so little i felt so out of things in italy i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london more not a cheap ticket like to day but to stop i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl
p00890_B,00890,B,we mustn t be unjust to people
p00891_B,00891,B,mother no it s impossible we can t have charlotte on the top of the other things we re squeezed to death as it is freddy s got a friend coming tuesday there s cecil and you ve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare it simply can t be done
p00892_B,00892,B,i beg your pardon
p00893_B,00893,B,no i don t think so mother cecil s all right
p00894_B,00894,B,her what
p00895_B,00895,B,my point is that you oughtn t to have asked charlotte to stop i wish you would keep to the point the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isn t raining oh for a little air
p00896_B,00896,B,emerson s a common enough name
p00897_B,00897,B,one thing and another among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if she d come up and see us and mercifully didn t
p00898_B,00898,B,perhaps i spoke hastily
p00899_B,00899,B,but has cecil
p00900_B,00900,B,all right mother
p00901_B,00901,B,i don t know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike
p00902_B,00902,B,you can t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do
p00903_B,00903,B,is that house to let again powell
p00904_B,00904,B,i tore the thing up
p00905_B,00905,B,because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england i shall tell them then it s much pleasanter how wet it is let s turn in here oh well let it be shop then let s go to mudie s i ll buy a guide book
p00906_B,00906,B,because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears i ve given up cecil may begin again
p00907_B,00907,B,let me just put your bonnet away may i
p00908_B,00908,B,well she would leave florence so stupidly she flurried
p00909_B,00909,B,it s only the library book that cecil s been reading
p00910_B,00910,B,oh very slightly i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did
p00911_B,00911,B,i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly
p00912_B,00912,B,all right
p00913_B,00913,B,oh dear what shall i do what shall i do
p00914_B,00914,B,no i hate seeings off
p00915_B,00915,B,oh i had no idea
p00916_B,00916,B,if minnie sleeps in the bath not otherwise
p00917_B,00917,B,it s only another muddle of freddy s freddy doesn t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead
p00918_B,00918,B,i want more independence
p00919_B,00919,B,mrs honeychurch i meant to i can t i really can t turn out miss flack
p00920_B,00920,B,but what can i do an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden
p00921_B,00921,B,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p00922_B,00922,B,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p00923_B,00923,B,am i not always right she ought to have gone before the contract was signed does she still live rent free as she did in her nephew s time
p00924_B,00924,B,turn her out
p00925_B,00925,B,you ought to find a tenant at once it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk
p00926_B,00926,B,hopeless vulgarian
p00927_B,00927,B,the rent is absurdly low and perhaps i am an easy landlord but it is such an awkward size it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves
p00928_B,00928,B,exactly that is exactly what i fear mr vyse it will attract the wrong type of people the train service has improved a fatal improvement to my mind and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles
p00929_B,00929,B,then may i write to my misses alan
p00930_B,00930,B,rather a strenuous clerk it would be sir harry i have an idea how would you like spinsters
p00931_B,00931,B,yes i met them abroad
p00932_B,00932,B,the misses alan aren t that
p00933_B,00933,B,my dear lucy it would be splendid do you know any such
p00934_B,00934,B,indeed you may here we are with the difficulty solved already how delightful it is extra facilities please tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees oh the agents the appalling people they have sent me one woman when i wrote a tactful letter you know asking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance as if one cares about that and several references i took up were most unsatisfactory people swindlers or not respectable and oh the deceit i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week the deceit of the most promising people my dear lucy the deceit
p00935_B,00935,B,it s i who am tiresome i oughtn t to come with my troubles to young people but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help
p00936_B,00936,B,exactly the miss alans
p00937_B,00937,B,i meant it s better not i really mean it
p00938_B,00938,B,yes so do i i vote you have a men s four
p00939_B,00939,B,my dear baby how tiresome you ve been you have no business to take them bathing in the sacred lake it s much too public it was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else do be more careful you forget the place is growing half suburban

p01031_B,01031,B,looking at italian art there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it
p01032_B,01032,B,and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write we are all so glad that you have come
p01033_B,01033,B,that s the best conversational opening i ve ever heard but i m afraid it will only act between men can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do come and have a bathe and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal

p01078_B,01078,B,there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows choose a place where you won t do harm yes choose a place where you won t do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine

p01095_B,01095,B,no good but surely i have a right to hear a little more
p01096_B,01096,B,all modern books are bad every one writes for money in these days
p01097_B,01097,B,who may miss lavish be
p01098_B,01098,B,it is true i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother you are even greater than i thought i m not going to worry you you are far too good to me i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldn t marry me and so have given me a chance to improve i have never known you till this evening i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be but this evening you are a different person new thoughts even a new voice
p01099_B,01099,B,no i can t well never mind the tennis why couldn t you couldn t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong you talked of our wedding at lunch at least you let me talk
p01100_B,01100,B,you had that bad headache yesterday all right i see it s much more than headaches but give me a moment s time you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other part i find it difficult i am likely to say the wrong thing
p01101_B,01101,B,you don t love me evidently i dare say you are right not to but it would hurt a little less if i knew why
p01102_B,01102,B,chapter two find me chapter two if it isn t bothering you here hand me the book
p01103_B,01103,B,i never do play tennis i never could play i don t understand a word you say
p01104_B,01104,B,i mean that a new person seems speaking through you
p01105_B,01105,B,how are my proteges
p01106_B,01106,B,now play us the other garden the one in parsifal
p01107_B,01107,B,this isn t the passage i wanted there is another much funnier further on
p01108_B,01108,B,but i love you and i did think you loved me
p01109_B,01109,B,i cannot think you were right i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly it s all too horrible
p01110_B,01110,B,i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p01111_B,01111,B,it is a question between ideals yours and mine pure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new i must actually thank you for what you have done for showing me what i really am solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman will you shake hands
p01112_B,01112,B,joseph emery prank
p01113_B,01113,B,well you sound tired as if something has worried you
p01114_B,01114,B,i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead it is the first thing that i remember cecil do read the thing about the view
p01115_B,01115,B,good bye cecil
p01116_B,01116,B,how do you like this view of ours mr emerson
p01117_B,01117,B,oh yes you do think it it s your old idea the idea that has kept europe back i mean the idea that women are always thinking of men if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says it s disgusting brutal as if a girl can t break it off for the sake of freedom
p01118_B,01118,B,no read away i think nothing s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go
p01119_B,01119,B,all right cecil that will do don t apologize to me it was my mistake
p01120_B,01120,B,i haven t had a really good education for one thing my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should
p01121_B,01121,B,because you re the sort who can t know any one intimately i don t mean exactly that but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something it is that more or less when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now you re always protecting me i won t be protected i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right to shield me is an insult can t i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you a woman s place you despise my mother i know you do because she s conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodness conventional cecil you re that for you may understand beautiful things but you don t know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me i won t be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me that s why i break off my engagement you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people
p01122_B,01122,B,i am very sorry about it i have carefully thought things over we are too different i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl
p01123_B,01123,B,anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife
p01124_B,01124,B,what s the good of a scene
p01125_B,01125,B,oh cecil
p01126_B,01126,B,oh a dreadful person mr emerson you remember miss lavish
p01127_B,01127,B,what do you mean by a new voice
p01128_B,01128,B,you can play well enough to make up a four i thought it abominably selfish of you
p01129_B,01129,B,what if i do it doesn t prevent me from realizing the truth i can t marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day
p01130_B,01130,B,i did not i thought i did at first i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too
p01131_B,01131,B,it isn t worth reading it s too silly to read i never saw such rubbish it oughtn t to be allowed to be printed
p01132_B,01132,B,there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to you when you wouldn t play tennis with freddy
p01133_B,01133,B,if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken
p01134_B,01134,B,proteges you shall see for yourself how your proteges are george emerson is coming up this afternoon he is a most interesting man to talk to only don t
p01135_B,01135,B,what fun cecil read away come mr emerson sit down after all your energy
p01136_B,01136,B,true on the whole
p01137_B,01137,B,should we go in to tea
p01138_B,01138,B,don t open the window and you d better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside i really think we had better go to bed if you don t mind i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking
p01139_B,01139,B,i knew you wouldn t understand i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations of course it isn t the tennis that was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wife for instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband i don t think so you don t like freddy nor my mother there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it until well until all things came to a point they have to day i see clearly i must speak that s all
p01140_B,01140,B,mr emerson have you any brothers or sisters
p01141_B,01141,B,of course i will good night cecil good bye that s all right i m sorry about it thank you very much for your gentleness
p01142_B,01142,B,indeed why it s miss lavish it s miss lavish s novel and she s publishing it under somebody else s name
p01143_B,01143,B,tired that is exactly like you you always think women don t mean what they say
p01144_B,01144,B,not for me thank you i will not spoil the set
p01145_B,01145,B,my dear freddy i am no athlete as you well remarked this very morning i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you

p01147_B,01147,B,i m so glad you only talked about books cecil s hard hit lucy won t marry him if you d gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down
p01148_B,01148,B,oh come along cecil i m bad floyd s rotten and so i dare say s emerson
p01149_B,01149,B,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p01150_B,01150,B,then certainly i won t play
p01151_B,01151,B,h m

p01154_B,01154,B,they re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy won t play with me in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday
p01155_B,01155,B,i shall miss every ball anyway so what does it matter
p01156_B,01156,B,my father says that there is only one perfect view the view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it
p01157_B,01157,B,he told us another day that views are really crowds crowds of trees and houses and hills and are bound to resemble each other like human crowds and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason for a crowd is more than the people who make it up something gets added to it no one knows how just as something has got added to those hills
p01158_B,01158,B,am i really to go
p01159_B,01159,B,you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse
