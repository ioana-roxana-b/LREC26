p00000_A,00000,A,i think we cannot do better let us send for the child
p00001_A,00001,A,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting
p00002_A,00002,A,i thoroughly understand you you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up
p00003_A,00003,A,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us
p00004_A,00004,A,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association
p00005_A,00005,A,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them
p00006_A,00006,A,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone
p00007_A,00007,A,fanny was good natured enough
p00008_A,00008,A,to be sure my dear that is very stupid indeed and shows a great want of genius and emulation but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference
p00009_A,00009,A,my dear sister if you can persuade him into anything of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever and i shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a frenchwoman all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason coax or trick him into marrying is inconceivable he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined if your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke let them avoid henry
p00010_A,00010,A,my dear brother i will not believe this of you
p00011_A,00011,A,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift
p00012_A,00012,A,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person
p00013_A,00013,A,oh yes i am not at all ashamed of it i would have everybody marry if they can do it properly i do not like to have people throw themselves away but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage
p00014_A,00014,A,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart
p00015_A,00015,A,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me
p00016_A,00016,A,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong
p00017_A,00017,A,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right
p00018_A,00018,A,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards
p00019_A,00019,A,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me
p00020_A,00020,A,oh for shame a prison indeed sotherton court is the noblest old place in the world
p00021_A,00021,A,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire
p00022_A,00022,A,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine
p00023_A,00023,A,that is what i was thinking of as he has done so well by smith i think i had better have him at once his terms are five guineas a day
p00024_A,00024,A,sir it is a moor park we bought it as a moor park and it cost us that is it was a present from sir thomas but i saw the bill and i know it cost seven shillings and was charged as a moor park
p00025_A,00025,A,you were imposed on ma am these potatoes have as much the flavour of a moor park apricot as the fruit from that tree it is an insipid fruit at the best but a good apricot is eatable which none from my garden are
p00026_A,00026,A,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all
p00027_A,00027,A,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather
p00028_A,00028,A,smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds which is little enough and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved now at sotherton we have a good seven hundred without reckoning the water meadows so that i think if so much could be done at compton we need not despair there have been two or three fine old trees cut down that grew too near the house and it opens the prospect amazingly which makes me think that repton or anybody of that sort would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill you know
p00029_A,00029,A,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton
p00030_A,00030,A,oh it does not signify whenever i do see it you will tell me how it has been altered
p00031_A,00031,A,i do not wish to influence mr rushworth but had i a place to new fashion i should not put myself into the hands of an improver i would rather have an inferior degree of beauty of my own choice and acquired progressively i would rather abide by my own blunders than by his
p00032_A,00032,A,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all
p00033_A,00033,A,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing
p00034_A,00034,A,no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the fewest possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be who loves me consults me confides in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and everything as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style that is a complete brother s letter
p00035_A,00035,A,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters
p00036_A,00036,A,my dear henry have you nothing to say you have been an improver yourself and from what i hear of everingham it may vie with any place in england its natural beauties i am sure are great everingham as it used to be was perfect in my estimation such a happy fall of ground and such timber what would i not give to see it again
p00037_A,00037,A,excessively but what with the natural advantages of the ground which pointed out even to a very young eye what little remained to be done and my own consequent resolutions i had not been of age three months before everingham was all that it is now my plan was laid at westminster a little altered perhaps at cambridge and at one and twenty executed i am inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him i have been a devourer of my own
p00038_A,00038,A,those who see quickly will resolve quickly and act quickly you can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth you should assist him with your opinion
p00039_A,00039,A,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you
p00040_A,00040,A,but where is fanny is she gone to bed
p00041_A,00041,A,no not that i know of she was here a moment ago
p00042_A,00042,A,that is a very foolish trick fanny to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have no work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new calico that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa
p00043_A,00043,A,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house
p00044_A,00044,A,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat
p00045_A,00045,A,did you go out in the heat
p00046_A,00046,A,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour
p00047_A,00047,A,fanny has been cutting roses has she
p00048_A,00048,A,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled
p00049_A,00049,A,the loss of her ladyship s company would be a great drawback and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at sotherton yet and it was a pity she should not see the place
p00050_A,00050,A,but why is it necessary that crawford s carriage or his only should be employed why is no use to be made of my mother s chaise i could not when the scheme was first mentioned the other day understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family
p00051_A,00051,A,what go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather when we may have seats in a barouche no my dear edmund that will not quite do
p00052_A,00052,A,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off
p00053_A,00053,A,unpleasant oh dear i believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat there can be no comparison as to one s view of the country probably miss crawford will choose the barouche box herself
p00054_A,00054,A,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected
p00055_A,00055,A,you can if i stay at home with you as i mean to do yes there is no necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home fanny has a great desire to see sotherton i know she wishes it very much she has not often a gratification of the kind and i am sure ma am you would be glad to give her the pleasure now
p00056_A,00056,A,oh yes very glad if your aunt sees no objection
p00057_A,00057,A,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it
p00058_A,00058,A,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny
p00059_A,00059,A,as there are five of you it will be better that one should sit with henry and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive julia i think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson
p00060_A,00060,A,here is a fine burst of country i wish you had my seat but i dare say you will not take it let me press you ever so much
p00061_A,00061,A,yes it is exactly behind the house begins at a little distance and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds you may see something of it here something of the more distant trees it is oak entirely
p00062_A,00062,A,now we are coming to the chapel which properly we ought to enter from above and look down upon but as we are quite among friends i will take you in this way if you will excuse me
p00063_A,00063,A,this chapel was fitted up as you see it in james the second s time before that period as i understand the pews were only wainscot and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth but this is not quite certain it is a handsome chapel and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain within the memory of many but the late mr rushworth left it off
p00064_A,00064,A,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine
p00065_A,00065,A,do look at mr rushworth and maria standing side by side exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed have not they completely the air of it
p00066_A,00066,A,if edmund were but in orders
p00067_A,00067,A,my dear edmund if you were but in orders now you might perform the ceremony directly how unlucky that you are not ordained mr rushworth and maria are quite ready
p00068_A,00068,A,for if we are too long going over the house we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors it is past two and we are to dine at five
p00069_A,00069,A,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn
p00070_A,00070,A,james i believe the wilderness will be new to all the party the miss bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet
p00071_A,00071,A,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest
p00072_A,00072,A,not i should hope of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom we do not look in great cities for our best morality it is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt a fine preacher is followed and admired but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character and observing his general conduct which in london can rarely be the case the clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners they are known to the largest part only as preachers and with regard to their influencing public manners miss crawford must not misunderstand me or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulators of refinement and courtesy the masters of the ceremonies of life the manners i speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps the result of good principles the effect in short of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i believe be everywhere found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to be so are the rest of the nation
p00073_A,00073,A,certainly
p00074_A,00074,A,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you
p00075_A,00075,A,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while
p00076_A,00076,A,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me
p00077_A,00077,A,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
p00078_A,00078,A,miss price all alone my dear fanny how comes this
p00079_A,00079,A,prohibited nonsense i certainly can get out that way and i will mr rushworth will be here in a moment you know we shall not be out of sight
p00080_A,00080,A,or if we are miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll the grove of oak on the knoll
p00081_A,00081,A,thank you my dear fanny but i and my gown are alive and well and so good bye
p00082_A,00082,A,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts
p00083_A,00083,A,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly
p00084_A,00084,A,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear
p00085_A,00085,A,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information
p00086_A,00086,A,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away
p00087_A,00087,A,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp
p00088_A,00088,A,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it
p00089_A,00089,A,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant
p00090_A,00090,A,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman
p00091_A,00091,A,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it
p00092_A,00092,A,a strange business this in america dr grant what is your opinion i always come to you to know what i am to think of public matters
p00093_A,00093,A,my dear tom as you are not dancing i dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber shall you
p00094_A,00094,A,we want to make a table for mrs rushworth you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him
p00095_A,00095,A,it was a hard case upon my word i do think you were very much to be pitied
p00096_A,00096,A,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager
p00097_A,00097,A,oh for the ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with
p00098_A,00098,A,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice
p00099_A,00099,A,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough
p00100_A,00100,A,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more
p00101_A,00101,A,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery
p00102_A,00102,A,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one
p00103_A,00103,A,i think it would be very wrong in a general light private theatricals are open to some objections but as we are circumstanced i must think it would be highly injudicious and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind it would shew great want of feeling on my father s account absent as he is and in some degree of constant danger and it would be imprudent i think with regard to maria whose situation is a very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate
p00104_A,00104,A,what is the matter i was not asleep
p00105_A,00105,A,oh dear no ma am nobody suspected you well edmund
p00106_A,00106,A,no want of hands in our theatre miss bertram no want of understrappers my sister desires her love and hopes to be admitted into the company and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante that you may not like to do yourselves
p00107_A,00107,A,oh no that will never do let us have no ranting tragedies too many characters not a tolerable woman s part in the play anything but that my dear tom it would be impossible to fill it up one could not expect anybody to take such a part nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end that might do perhaps but for the low parts if i must give my opinion i have always thought it the most insipid play in the english language i do not wish to make objections i shall be happy to be of any use but i think we could not chuse worse
p00108_A,00108,A,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford
p00109_A,00109,A,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away
p00110_A,00110,A,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better
p00111_A,00111,A,no no julia must not be amelia it is not at all the part for her she would not like it she would not do well she is too tall and robust amelia should be a small light girlish skipping figure it is fit for miss crawford and miss crawford only she looks the part and i am persuaded will do it admirably
p00112_A,00112,A,you must oblige us indeed you must when you have studied the character i am sure you will feel it suit you tragedy may be your choice but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you you will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions you will not refuse to visit me in prison i think i see you coming in with your basket
p00113_A,00113,A,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia
p00114_A,00114,A,we have got a play it is to be lovers vows and i am to be count cassel and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit by way of a shooting dress i do not know how i shall like it
p00115_A,00115,A,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part
p00116_A,00116,A,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia
p00117_A,00117,A,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak
p00118_A,00118,A,i am much obliged to you edmund you mean very well i am sure but i still think you see things too strongly and i really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind there would be the greatest indecorum i think
p00119_A,00119,A,i am convinced madam that sir thomas would not like it
p00120_A,00120,A,there my dear do you hear what edmund says
p00121_A,00121,A,what if she knew your reasons
p00122_A,00122,A,well how do you go on what have you settled oh we can do nothing without you
p00123_A,00123,A,my good friends you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses inside and out but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile who is to be anhalt what gentleman among you am i to have the pleasure of making love to
p00124_A,00124,A,mr rushworth was to be count cassel but no one had yet undertaken anhalt
p00125_A,00125,A,the count has two and forty speeches which is no trifle
p00126_A,00126,A,i am not at all surprised at this want of an anhalt amelia deserves no better such a forward young lady may well frighten the men
p00127_A,00127,A,that circumstance would by no means tempt me for i should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting it must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing a formal solemn lecturer and the man who chuses the profession itself is perhaps one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage
p00128_A,00128,A,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act
p00129_A,00129,A,indeed but you must for we cannot excuse you it need not frighten you it is a nothing of a part a mere nothing not above half a dozen speeches altogether and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say so you may be as creep mouse as you like but we must have you to look at
p00130_A,00130,A,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn
p00131_A,00131,A,phoo phoo do not be so shamefaced you ll do it very well every allowance will be made for you we do not expect perfection you must get a brown gown and a white apron and a mob cap and we must make you a few wrinkles and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes and you will be a very proper little old woman
p00132_A,00132,A,you must excuse me indeed you must excuse me
p00133_A,00133,A,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more
p00134_A,00134,A,i am not going to urge her but i shall think her a very obstinate ungrateful girl if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her very ungrateful indeed considering who and what she is
p00135_A,00135,A,but there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it we have but to speak the word we may pick and chuse i could name at this moment at least six young men within six miles of us who are wild to be admitted into our company and there are one or two that would not disgrace us i should not be afraid to trust either of the olivers or charles maddox tom oliver is a very clever fellow and charles maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere so i will take my horse early to morrow morning and ride over to stoke and settle with one of them
p00136_A,00136,A,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly
p00137_A,00137,A,one cannot wonder sister that fanny should be delighted it is all new to her you know you and i used to be very fond of a play ourselves and so am i still and as soon as i am a little more at leisure i mean to look in at their rehearsals too what is the play about fanny you have never told me
p00138_A,00138,A,you had better stay till the curtain is hung the curtain will be hung in a day or two there is very little sense in a play without a curtain and i am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons
p00139_A,00139,A,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it
p00140_A,00140,A,dr grant is ill he has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today he fancied it tough sent away his plate and has been suffering ever since
p00141_A,00141,A,if miss price would be so good as to read the part
p00142_A,00142,A,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you
p00143_A,00143,A,and i do believe she can say every word of it for she could put mrs grant right the other day in twenty places fanny i am sure you know the part
p00144_A,00144,A,still the same anxiety for everybody s comfort my dear mrs norris but indeed i would rather have nothing but tea
p00145_A,00145,A,well then lady bertram suppose you speak for tea directly suppose you hurry baddeley a little he seems behindhand to night
p00146_A,00146,A,indeed and what have you been acting
p00147_A,00147,A,oh they ll tell you all about it
p00148_A,00148,A,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon
p00149_A,00149,A,something must be done
p00150_A,00150,A,i come from your theatre i found myself in it rather unexpectedly its vicinity to my own room but in every respect indeed it took me by surprise as i had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character it appears a neat job however as far as i could judge by candlelight and does my friend christopher jackson credit
p00151_A,00151,A,this was in fact the origin of our acting my friend yates brought the infection from ecclesford and it spread as those things always spread you know sir the faster probably from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly it was like treading old ground again
p00152_A,00152,A,to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not unsuccessfully upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the crawfords being gone home that nothing more can be done to night but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening i should not be afraid of the result we bespeak your indulgence you understand as young performers we bespeak your indulgence
p00153_A,00153,A,my indulgence shall be given sir but without any other rehearsal i come home to be happy and indulgent mr and miss crawford were mentioned in my last letters from mansfield do you find them agreeable acquaintance
p00154_A,00154,A,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl
p00155_A,00155,A,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing
p00156_A,00156,A,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight
p00157_A,00157,A,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish
p00158_A,00158,A,i may perhaps get as far as banbury to day
p00159_A,00159,A,whose stables do you use at bath
p00160_A,00160,A,that is impossible fanny he must like him less after to morrow s visit for we shall be five hours in his company i should dread the stupidity of the day if there were not a much greater evil to follow the impression it must leave on sir thomas he cannot much longer deceive himself i am sorry for them all and would give something that rushworth and maria had never met
p00161_A,00161,A,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections
p00162_A,00162,A,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again
p00163_A,00163,A,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking
p00164_A,00164,A,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may
p00165_A,00165,A,thank you but there is no escaping these little vexations mary live where we may and when you are settled in town and i come to see you i dare say i shall find you with yours in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer perhaps on their very account their remoteness and unpunctuality or their exorbitant charges and frauds will be drawing forth bitter lamentations
p00166_A,00166,A,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago
p00167_A,00167,A,very well very well all the better i am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house but miss price and mr edmund bertram i dare say would take their chance we none of us want to hear the bill of fare a friendly meeting and not a fine dinner is all we have in view a turkey or a goose or a leg of mutton or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us
p00168_A,00168,A,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not
p00169_A,00169,A,i cannot imagine why mrs grant should think of asking her she never did before she used to ask your sisters now and then but she never asked fanny
p00170_A,00170,A,if you cannot do without me ma am
p00171_A,00171,A,as you please ma am on that head but i meant my father s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation s being accepted or not and i think he will consider it a right thing by mrs grant as well as by fanny that being the first invitation it should be accepted
p00172_A,00172,A,sir thomas stop a moment i have something to say to you
p00173_A,00173,A,she will be late but what is your difficulty
p00174_A,00174,A,so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her
p00175_A,00175,A,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister
p00176_A,00176,A,your sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend the day with us and i shall certainly be at home
p00177_A,00177,A,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go
p00178_A,00178,A,my dear sir thomas fanny can walk
p00179_A,00179,A,walk my niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year will twenty minutes after four suit you
p00180_A,00180,A,mr yates oh we hear nothing of mr yates i do not imagine he figures much in the letters to mansfield park do you miss price i think my friend julia knows better than to entertain her father with mr yates
p00181_A,00181,A,as far as i am concerned sir i would not have delayed his return for a day my uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough
p00182_A,00182,A,nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves you would look rather blank henry if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year
p00183_A,00183,A,bertram i shall make a point of coming to mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as i shall do not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil when will it be you must preach at mansfield you know that sir thomas and lady bertram may hear you
p00184_A,00184,A,i shall keep clear of you crawford as long as i can for you would be more likely to disconcert me and i should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man
p00185_A,00185,A,do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the commissioner s at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything
p00186_A,00186,A,i hope your ladyship is pleased with the game
p00187_A,00187,A,oh dear yes very entertaining indeed a very odd game i do not know what it is all about i am never to see my cards and mr crawford does all the rest
p00188_A,00188,A,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas
p00189_A,00189,A,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me
p00190_A,00190,A,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
p00191_A,00191,A,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours
p00192_A,00192,A,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes
p00193_A,00193,A,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told
p00194_A,00194,A,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered
p00195_A,00195,A,sotherton yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs rushworth will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr rushworth is a most amiable man they are at brighton now you know in one of the best houses there as mr rushworth s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to portsmouth if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins
p00196_A,00196,A,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own
p00197_A,00197,A,sir thomas undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest we must hope his son may prove that he knows it too
p00198_A,00198,A,yes very only i am soon tired
p00199_A,00199,A,i should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance have you never any balls at northampton i should like to see you dance and i d dance with you if you would for nobody would know who i was here and i should like to be your partner once more we used to jump about together many a time did not we when the hand organ was in the street i am a pretty good dancer in my way but i dare say you are a better is not fanny a very good dancer sir
p00200_A,00200,A,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long
p00201_A,00201,A,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of
p00202_A,00202,A,my daughters have their pleasures at brighton and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at mansfield will be for their cousins could we be all assembled our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement
p00203_A,00203,A,you must think of somebody else too when you wear that necklace you must think of henry for it was his choice in the first place he gave it to me and with the necklace i make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver it is to be a family remembrancer the sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too my dear child what are you afraid of do you think henry will claim the necklace as mine and fancy you did not come honestly by it or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago before he knew there was such a throat in the world or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire well then to convince me that you suspect no trick and are as unsuspicious of compliment as i have always found you take the necklace and say no more about it its being a gift of my brother s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it he is always giving me something or other i have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half and as for this necklace i do not suppose i have worn it six times it is very pretty but i never think of it and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words
p00204_A,00204,A,yes she does look very well chapman helped her to dress i sent chapman to her
p00205_A,00205,A,so soon my good friend it is three o clock and your sister is not used to these sort of hours
p00206_A,00206,A,well then fanny you shall not get up to morrow before i go sleep as long as you can and never mind me
p00207_A,00207,A,oh yes sir i must get up and breakfast with him it will be the last time you know the last morning
p00208_A,00208,A,you had better not he is to have breakfasted and be gone by half past nine mr crawford i think you call for him at half past nine
p00209_A,00209,A,i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to morrow
p00210_A,00210,A,i cannot think what is the matter with me i feel quite stupid it must be sitting up so late last night fanny you must do something to keep me awake i cannot work fetch the cards i feel so very stupid
p00211_A,00211,A,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you
p00212_A,00212,A,and that is not very likely to be sir thomas who should invite her maria might be very glad to see her at sotherton now and then but she would not think of asking her to live there and i am sure she is better off here and besides i cannot do without her
p00213_A,00213,A,no i do not
p00214_A,00214,A,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her
p00215_A,00215,A,it is amazing how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they little think how much it comes to or what their parents or their uncles and aunts pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them all together i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what i do for them
p00216_A,00216,A,very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having i wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two shawls fanny
p00217_A,00217,A,no ma am it is miss price i am certain of its being miss price
p00218_A,00218,A,my dear there is no occasion for this your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing more to be said or done from this hour the subject is never to be revived between us you will have nothing to fear or to be agitated about you cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations your happiness and advantage are all that i have in view and nothing is required of you but to bear with mr crawford s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his he proceeds at his own risk you are on safe ground i have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred you will see him with the rest of us in the same manner and as much as you can dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant he leaves northamptonshire so soon that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded the future must be very uncertain and now my dear fanny this subject is closed between us
p00219_A,00219,A,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that
p00220_A,00220,A,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps
p00221_A,00221,A,no doubt one is familiar with shakespeare in a degree from one s earliest years his celebrated passages are quoted by everybody they are in half the books we open and we all talk shakespeare use his similes and describe with his descriptions but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent
p00222_A,00222,A,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk
p00223_A,00223,A,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise
p00224_A,00224,A,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing
p00225_A,00225,A,a sermon well delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to compose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of the pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers on subjects limited and long worn threadbare in all common hands who can say anything new or striking anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to the educated to those who were capable of estimating my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy
p00226_A,00226,A,yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two distinct orders of being you and miss crawford have made me too nice
p00227_A,00227,A,you are just in time we have been looking for you this half hour the thrush went out of harbour this morning i saw her it was a beautiful sight and they think she will have her orders in a day or two and mr campbell was here at four o clock to ask for you he has got one of the thrush s boats and is going off to her at six and hoped you would be here in time to go with him
p00228_A,00228,A,i was upstairs mama moving my things you know you had but just settled that my sister fanny and i should have the other room and i could not get rebecca to give me any help
p00229_A,00229,A,ha that s just where i should have put her myself it s the best berth at spithead but here is my sister sir here is fanny it is so dark you do not see her
p00230_A,00230,A,devil take those young dogs how they are singing out ay sam s voice louder than all the rest that boy is fit for a boatswain holla you there sam stop your confounded pipe or i shall be after you
p00231_A,00231,A,come girls come fan come sue take care of yourselves keep a sharp lookout
p00232_A,00232,A,mansfield sotherton thornton lacey what a society will be comprised in those houses and at michaelmas perhaps a fourth may be added some small hunting box in the vicinity of everything so dear for as to any partnership in thornton lacey as edmund bertram once good humouredly proposed i hope i foresee two objections two fair excellent irresistible objections to that plan
p00233_A,00233,A,i do not know i have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt perhaps i may be to stay longer it may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months end
p00234_A,00234,A,i know mansfield i know its way i know its faults towards you i know the danger of your being so far forgotten as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family i am aware that you may be left here week after week if sir thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself or sending your aunt s maid for you without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year this will not do two months is an ample allowance i should think six weeks quite enough i am considering your sister s health which i think the confinement of portsmouth unfavourable to she requires constant air and exercise when you know her as well as i do i am sure you will agree that she does and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country if therefore you find yourself growing unwell and any difficulties arise about your returning to mansfield without waiting for the two months to be ended that must not be regarded as of any consequence if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual and will only let my sister know it give her only the slightest hint she and i will immediately come down and take you back to mansfield you know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done you know all that would be felt on the occasion i am perfectly serious as you perfectly know and i hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition indeed you shall not it shall not be in your power for so long only as you positively say in every letter to mary i am well and i know you cannot speak or write a falsehood so long only shall you be considered as well
p00235_A,00235,A,my poor sister bertram must be in a great deal of trouble
p00236_A,00236,A,it is a mistake sir it must be a mistake it cannot be true it must mean some other people
p00237_A,00237,A,dear fanny now i shall be comfortable
p00000_B,00000,B,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting
p00001_B,00001,B,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us
p00002_B,00002,B,yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companions of her own age and of a regular instructress
p00003_B,00003,B,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends
p00004_B,00004,B,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone
p00005_B,00005,B,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct
p00006_B,00006,B,this is not a very promising beginning after all that i said to her as we came along i thought she would have behaved better i told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first i wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper her poor mother had a good deal but we must make allowances for such a child and i do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her for with all its faults it was her home and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better but then there is moderation in all things
p00007_B,00007,B,my dear it is very bad but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself
p00008_B,00008,B,so fanny you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it
p00009_B,00009,B,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift
p00010_B,00010,B,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him
p00011_B,00011,B,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person
p00012_B,00012,B,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls
p00013_B,00013,B,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best
p00014_B,00014,B,we must leave him to himself i believe talking does no good he will be taken in at last
p00015_B,00015,B,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson
p00016_B,00016,B,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards
p00017_B,00017,B,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting
p00018_B,00018,B,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me
p00019_B,00019,B,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her
p00020_B,00020,B,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire
p00021_B,00021,B,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine
p00022_B,00022,B,well and if they were ten i am sure you need not regard it the expense need not be any impediment if i were you i should not think of the expense i would have everything done in the best style and made as nice as possible such a place as sotherton court deserves everything that taste and money can do you have space to work upon there and grounds that will well reward you for my own part if i had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of sotherton i should be always planting and improving for naturally i am excessively fond of it it would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where i am now with my little half acre it would be quite a burlesque but if i had more room i should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting we did a vast deal in that way at the parsonage we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it you young ones do not remember much about it perhaps but if dear sir thomas were here he could tell you what improvements we made and a great deal more would have been done but for poor mr norris s sad state of health he could hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything and that disheartened me from doing several things that sir thomas and i used to talk of if it had not been for that we should have carried on the garden wall and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard just as dr grant has done we were always doing something as it was it was only the spring twelvemonth before mr norris s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall which is now grown such a noble tree and getting to such perfection sir
p00023_B,00023,B,the tree thrives well beyond a doubt madam the soil is good and i never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering
p00024_B,00024,B,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all
p00025_B,00025,B,smith s place is the admiration of all the country and it was a mere nothing before repton took it in hand i think i shall have repton
p00026_B,00026,B,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather
p00027_B,00027,B,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton
p00028_B,00028,B,cut down an avenue what a pity does it not make you think of cowper ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited
p00029_B,00029,B,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny
p00030_B,00030,B,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well
p00031_B,00031,B,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all
p00032_B,00032,B,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay
p00033_B,00033,B,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters
p00034_B,00034,B,miss price has a brother at sea whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us
p00035_B,00035,B,at sea has she in the king s service of course
p00036_B,00036,B,you are fond of the sort of thing
p00037_B,00037,B,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you
p00038_B,00038,B,well fanny and how do you like miss crawford now how did you like her yesterday
p00039_B,00039,B,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her
p00040_B,00040,B,that is a very foolish trick fanny to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have no work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new calico that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa
p00041_B,00041,B,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house
p00042_B,00042,B,fanny i am sure you have the headache i can hardly believe you i know your looks too well how long have you had it
p00043_B,00043,B,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat
p00044_B,00044,B,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour
p00045_B,00045,B,yes indeed edmund i was out above an hour i sat three quarters of an hour in the flower garden while fanny cut the roses and very pleasant it was i assure you but very hot it was shady enough in the alcove but i declare i quite dreaded the coming home again
p00046_B,00046,B,fanny has been cutting roses has she
p00047_B,00047,B,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled
p00048_B,00048,B,what has she been walking as well as cutting roses walking across the hot park to your house and doing it twice ma am no wonder her head aches
p00049_B,00049,B,oh no i cannot do without fanny
p00050_B,00050,B,besides i know that mr crawford depends upon taking us after what passed at first he would claim it as a promise
p00051_B,00051,B,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off
p00052_B,00052,B,there is no hardship i suppose nothing unpleasant in going on the barouche box
p00053_B,00053,B,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected
p00054_B,00054,B,to be sure not but i cannot do without her
p00055_B,00055,B,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it
p00056_B,00056,B,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny
p00057_B,00057,B,i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you
p00058_B,00058,B,fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires
p00059_B,00059,B,now we shall have no more rough road miss crawford our difficulties are over the rest of the way is such as it ought to be mr rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate here begins the village those cottages are really a disgrace the church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome i am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places the annoyance of the bells must be terrible there is the parsonage a tidy looking house and i understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people those are almshouses built by some of the family to the right is the steward s house he is a very respectable man now we are coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still it is not ugly you see at this end there is some fine timber but the situation of the house is dreadful we go down hill to it for half a mile and it is a pity for it would not be an ill looking place if it had a better approach
p00060_B,00060,B,now where is the avenue the house fronts the east i perceive the avenue therefore must be at the back of it mr rushworth talked of the west front
p00061_B,00061,B,i am disappointed this is not my idea of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no aisles no arches no inscriptions no banners no banners cousin to be blown by the night wind of heaven no signs that a
p00062_B,00062,B,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements
p00063_B,00063,B,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine
p00064_B,00064,B,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom
p00065_B,00065,B,if he would give her away
p00066_B,00066,B,how distressed she will be at what she said just now
p00067_B,00067,B,ordained what are you to be a clergyman
p00068_B,00068,B,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn
p00069_B,00069,B,this is insufferably hot shall any of us object to being comfortable here is a nice little wood if one can but get into it what happiness if the door should not be locked but of course it is for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like so you are to be a clergyman mr bertram this is rather a surprise to me
p00070_B,00070,B,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor
p00071_B,00071,B,certainly
p00072_B,00072,B,there you have quite convinced miss price already
p00073_B,00073,B,i wish i could convince miss crawford too
p00074_B,00074,B,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while
p00075_B,00075,B,thank you but i am not at all tired
p00076_B,00076,B,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
p00077_B,00077,B,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile
p00078_B,00078,B,it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are so far from the house already
p00079_B,00079,B,you will hurt yourself miss bertram you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes you will tear your gown you will be in danger of slipping into the ha ha you had better not go
p00080_B,00080,B,thank you my dear fanny but i and my gown are alive and well and so good bye
p00081_B,00081,B,but julia mr rushworth will be here in a moment with the key do wait for mr rushworth
p00082_B,00082,B,but that i am sure it has not
p00083_B,00083,B,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors
p00084_B,00084,B,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision
p00085_B,00085,B,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp
p00086_B,00086,B,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it
p00087_B,00087,B,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant
p00088_B,00088,B,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman
p00089_B,00089,B,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night
p00090_B,00090,B,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons
p00091_B,00091,B,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene
p00092_B,00092,B,we want to make a table for mrs rushworth you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him
p00093_B,00093,B,i should be most happy it would give me the greatest pleasure but that i am this moment going to dance come fanny do not be dawdling any longer or the dance will be over
p00094_B,00094,B,a pretty modest request upon my word to want to nail me to a card table for the next two hours with herself and dr grant who are always quarrelling and that poking old woman who knows no more of whist than of algebra i wish my good aunt would be a little less busy and to ask me in such a way too without ceremony before them all so as to leave me no possibility of refusing that is what i dislike most particularly it raises my spleen more than anything to have the pretence of being asked of being given a choice and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing whatever it be if i had not luckily thought of standing up with you i could not have got out of it it is a great deal too bad but when my aunt has got a fancy in her head nothing can stop her
p00095_B,00095,B,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager
p00096_B,00096,B,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice
p00097_B,00097,B,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough
p00098_B,00098,B,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more
p00099_B,00099,B,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery
p00100_B,00100,B,nay let us do nothing by halves if we are to act let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit boxes and gallery and let us have a play entire from beginning to end so as it be a german play no matter what with a good tricking shifting afterpiece and a figure dance and a hornpipe and a song between the acts if we do not outdo ecclesford we do nothing
p00101_B,00101,B,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one
p00102_B,00102,B,such a horribly vile billiard table as ours is not to be met with i believe above ground i can stand it no longer and i think i may say that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again but one good thing i have just ascertained it is the very room for a theatre precisely the shape and length for it and the doors at the farther end communicating with each other as they may be made to do in five minutes by merely moving the bookcase in my father s room is the very thing we could have desired if we had sat down to wish for it and my father s room will be an excellent greenroom it seems to join the billiard room on purpose
p00103_B,00103,B,by jove this won t do to be sure my dear mother your anxiety i was unlucky there
p00104_B,00104,B,but this i will maintain that we shall be doing no harm
p00105_B,00105,B,i cannot agree with you i am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it
p00106_B,00106,B,this will never do we are wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on no matter what so that something is chosen we must not be so nice a few characters too many must not frighten us we must double them we must descend a little if a part is insignificant the greater our credit in making anything of it from this moment i make no difficulties i take any part you chuse to give me so as it be comic let it but be comic i condition for nothing more lovers vows and why should not lovers vows do for us as well as for the ravenshaws how came it never to be thought of before it strikes me as if it would do exactly what say you all here are two capital tragic parts for yates and crawford and here is the rhyming butler for me if nobody else wants it a trifling part but the sort of thing i should not dislike and as i said before i am determined to take anything and do my best and as for the rest they may be filled up by anybody it is only count cassel and anhalt
p00107_B,00107,B,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford
p00108_B,00108,B,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away
p00109_B,00109,B,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better
p00110_B,00110,B,with all your partiality for cottager s wife it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed on we must not allow her to accept the part she must not be left to her own complaisance her talents will be wanted in amelia amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even agatha i consider amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece it requires great powers great nicety to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance i have seen good actresses fail in the part simplicity indeed is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession it requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not it requires a gentlewoman a julia bertram you will undertake it i hope
p00111_B,00111,B,you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when i come in with a basket of provisions though one might have supposed but it is only as agatha that i was to be so overpowering
p00112_B,00112,B,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia
p00113_B,00113,B,i am sure i would give up the part to julia most willingly but that though i shall probably do it very ill i feel persuaded she would do it worse
p00114_B,00114,B,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part
p00115_B,00115,B,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia
p00116_B,00116,B,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak
p00117_B,00117,B,we see things very differently i am perfectly acquainted with the play i assure you and with a very few omissions and so forth which will be made of course i can see nothing objectionable in it and i am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation
p00118_B,00118,B,do not act anything improper my dear sir thomas would not like it fanny ring the bell i must have my dinner to be sure julia is dressed by this time
p00119_B,00119,B,if i were to decline the part julia would certainly take it
p00120_B,00120,B,what if she knew your reasons
p00121_B,00121,B,i was just going to say the very same thing if every play is to be objected to you will act nothing and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away and i am sure that would be a discredit to us all i do not know the play but as maria says if there is anything a little too warm and it is so with most of them it can be easily left out we must not be over precise edmund as mr rushworth is to act too there can be no harm i only wish tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began for there was the loss of half a day s work about those side doors the curtain will be a good job however the maids do their work very well and i think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings there is no occasion to put them so very close together i am of some use i hope in preventing waste and making the most of things there should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones i forgot to tell tom of something that happened to me this very day i had been looking about me in the poultry yard and was just coming out when who should i see but dick jackson making up to the servants hall door with two bits of deal board in his hand bringing them to father you may be sure mother had chanced to send him of a message to father and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board for he could not no how do without them i knew what all this meant for the servants dinner bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads and as i hate such encroaching people the jacksons are very encroaching i have always said so just the sort of people to get all they can i said to the boy directly a great lubberly fellow of ten years old you know who ought to be ashamed of himself i ll take the boards to your father dick so get you home again as fast as you can the boy looked very silly and turned away without offering a word for i believe i might speak pretty sharp and i dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while i hate such greediness so good as your father is to the family employing the man all the year round
p00122_B,00122,B,my good friends you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses inside and out but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile who is to be anhalt what gentleman among you am i to have the pleasure of making love to
p00123_B,00123,B,i had my choice of the parts but i thought i should like the count best though i do not much relish the finery i am to have
p00124_B,00124,B,you chose very wisely i am sure anhalt is a heavy part
p00125_B,00125,B,i should be but too happy in taking the part if it were possible but unluckily the butler and anhalt are in together i will not entirely give it up however i will try what can be done i will look it over again
p00126_B,00126,B,your brother should take the part do not you think he would
p00127_B,00127,B,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act
p00128_B,00128,B,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn
p00129_B,00129,B,it is not that i am afraid of learning by heart but i really cannot act
p00130_B,00130,B,yes yes you can act well enough for us learn your part and we will teach you all the rest you have only two scenes and as i shall be cottager i ll put you in and push you about and you will do it very well i ll answer for it
p00131_B,00131,B,what a piece of work here is about nothing i am quite ashamed of you fanny to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort so kind as they are to you take the part with a good grace and let us hear no more of the matter i entreat
p00132_B,00132,B,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more
p00133_B,00133,B,i do not like my situation this place is too hot for me
p00134_B,00134,B,never mind my dear miss price this is a cross evening everybody is cross and teasing but do not let us mind them
p00135_B,00135,B,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly
p00136_B,00136,B,come in
p00137_B,00137,B,i believe there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once
p00138_B,00138,B,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it
p00139_B,00139,B,dr grant is ill he has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today he fancied it tough sent away his plate and has been suffering ever since
p00140_B,00140,B,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you
p00141_B,00141,B,you have only to read the part
p00142_B,00142,B,and i do believe she can say every word of it for she could put mrs grant right the other day in twenty places fanny i am sure you know the part
p00143_B,00143,B,shall i go too had not i better go too will not it be right for me to go too
p00144_B,00144,B,how do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately sir thomas they have been acting we have been all alive with acting
p00145_B,00145,B,indeed and what have you been acting
p00146_B,00146,B,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon
p00147_B,00147,B,something must be done
p00148_B,00148,B,it is time to think of our visitors where did you leave miss crawford fanny
p00149_B,00149,B,then poor yates is all alone i will go and fetch him he will be no bad assistant when it all comes out
p00150_B,00150,B,oh not to him look so to all the others but not to him
p00151_B,00151,B,to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not unsuccessfully upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the crawfords being gone home that nothing more can be done to night but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening i should not be afraid of the result we bespeak your indulgence you understand as young performers we bespeak your indulgence
p00152_B,00152,B,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl
p00153_B,00153,B,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing
p00154_B,00154,B,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight
p00155_B,00155,B,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish
p00156_B,00156,B,if i had not been active and made a point of being introduced to his mother and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit i am as certain as i sit here that nothing would have come of it for mr rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle but i left no stone unturned i was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister and at last i did persuade her you know the distance to sotherton it was in the middle of winter and the roads almost impassable but i did persuade her
p00157_B,00157,B,i know how great how justly great your influence is with lady bertram and her children and am the more concerned that it should not have been
p00158_B,00158,B,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father
p00159_B,00159,B,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home
p00160_B,00160,B,but they are passed over i have been watching them this weather is all from the south
p00161_B,00161,B,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again
p00162_B,00162,B,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking
p00163_B,00163,B,upon my word you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends i ever met with there is no giving you a moment s uneasiness you do not know how much we have been suffering nor what chills we have felt but i have long thought mr bertram one of the worst subjects to work on in any little manoeuvre against common sense that a woman could be plagued with i had very little hope of him from the first but you mrs grant my sister my own sister i think i had a right to alarm you a little
p00164_B,00164,B,do not flatter yourself my dearest mary you have not the smallest chance of moving me i have my alarms but they are quite in a different quarter and if i could have altered the weather you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time for here are some of my plants which robert will leave out because the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking everybody at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because i know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the fatigues of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like grievances and make me think the weather most unseasonably close
p00165_B,00165,B,you intend to be very rich
p00166_B,00166,B,and you know what your dinner will be the turkey and i assure you a very fine one for my dear cook insists upon the turkey s being dressed to morrow
p00167_B,00167,B,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not
p00168_B,00168,B,if you cannot do without me ma am
p00169_B,00169,B,but my mother will have my father with her all the evening
p00170_B,00170,B,to be sure so i shall
p00171_B,00171,B,sir thomas stop a moment i have something to say to you
p00172_B,00172,B,well
p00173_B,00173,B,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister
p00174_B,00174,B,nothing can be more natural nor were there no sister in the case could anything in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence
p00175_B,00175,B,but can i do without her sir thomas
p00176_B,00176,B,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go
p00177_B,00177,B,and yet why should i be glad for am i not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me
p00178_B,00178,B,yes sir
p00179_B,00179,B,quite unnecessary a great deal too kind but edmund goes true it is upon edmund s account i observed he was hoarse on thursday night
p00180_B,00180,B,never happier never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly oh what a corrupted mind
p00181_B,00181,B,those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss
p00182_B,00182,B,bertram i shall make a point of coming to mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as i shall do not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil when will it be you must preach at mansfield you know that sir thomas and lady bertram may hear you
p00183_B,00183,B,will he not feel this no he can feel nothing as he ought
p00184_B,00184,B,and how do you think i mean to amuse myself mary on the days that i do not hunt i am grown too old to go out more than three times a week but i have a plan for the intermediate days and what do you think it is
p00185_B,00185,B,what shall i do sir thomas whist and speculation which will amuse me most very well then speculation if you please mrs grant i know nothing about it but fanny must teach me
p00186_B,00186,B,bertram i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home i told you i lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew trees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luck for i never do wrong without gaining by it i found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills a small stream before me to be forded a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentleman or half a gentleman s house to be seen excepting one to be presumed the parsonage within a stone s throw of the said knoll and church i found myself in short in thornton lacey
p00187_B,00187,B,it sounds like it but which way did you turn after passing sewell s farm
p00188_B,00188,B,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
p00189_B,00189,B,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours
p00190_B,00190,B,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes
p00191_B,00191,B,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told
p00192_B,00192,B,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered
p00193_B,00193,B,i should be sorry to have my powers of planning judged of by the day at sotherton i see things very differently now do not think of me as i appeared then
p00194_B,00194,B,sotherton yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs rushworth will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr rushworth is a most amiable man they are at brighton now you know in one of the best houses there as mr rushworth s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to portsmouth if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins
p00195_B,00195,B,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own
p00196_B,00196,B,i want to be your neighbour sir thomas as you have perhaps heard me telling miss price may i hope for your acquiescence and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant
p00197_B,00197,B,but you do not wish yourself at portsmouth william
p00198_B,00198,B,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long
p00199_B,00199,B,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of
p00200_B,00200,B,come fanny fanny what are you about we are going do not you see your aunt is going quick quick i cannot bear to keep good old wilcox waiting you should always remember the coachman and horses my dear sir thomas we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you and edmund and william
p00201_B,00201,B,i do not like william that you should leave northamptonshire without this indulgence it would give me pleasure to see you both dance you spoke of the balls at northampton your cousins have occasionally attended them but they would not altogether suit us now the fatigue would be too much for your aunt i believe we must not think of a northampton ball a dance at home would be more eligible and if
p00202_B,00202,B,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were
p00203_B,00203,B,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond
p00204_B,00204,B,perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to morrow he says he has business there but will not tell me what the first time he ever denied me his confidence but this is what we all come to all are supplanted sooner or later now i must apply to you for information pray what is henry going for well then i must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother and of talking of you by the way
p00205_B,00205,B,oh william
p00206_B,00206,B,what did she think of being up before you set off
p00207_B,00207,B,yes half past nine and i shall be punctual for there will be no kind sister to get up for me
p00208_B,00208,B,i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to morrow
p00209_B,00209,B,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you
p00210_B,00210,B,we miss our two young men and there is no reason to suppose but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent as to edmund we must learn to do without him this will be the last winter of his belonging to us as he has done
p00211_B,00211,B,yes but i wish he was not going away they are all going away i think i wish they would stay at home sir thomas i have been thinking and i am very glad we took fanny as we did for now the others are away we feel the good of it
p00212_B,00212,B,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it
p00213_B,00213,B,my dear henry where can you have been all this time sitting with them an hour and a half
p00214_B,00214,B,i must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone i have been wishing it more than you can have any idea knowing as i do what your feelings as a sister are i could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news i now bring he is made your brother is a lieutenant i have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother s promotion here are the letters which announce it this moment come to hand you will perhaps like to see them i will not talk of my own happiness great as it is for i think only of yours compared with you who has a right to be happy i have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world i have not lost a moment however the post was late this morning but there has not been since a moment s delay how impatient how anxious how wild i have been on the subject i will not attempt to describe how severely mortified how cruelly disappointed in not having it finished while i was in london i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from mansfield but though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth i could desire and exerted himself immediately there were difficulties from the absence of one friend and the engagements of another which at last i could no longer bear to stay the end of and knowing in what good hands i left the cause i came away on monday trusting that many posts would not pass before i should be followed by such very letters as these my uncle who is the very best man in the world has exerted himself as i knew he would after seeing your brother he was delighted with him i would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted or to repeat half that the admiral said in his praise i deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend as this day does prove it now i may say that even i could not require william price to excite a greater interest or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together
p00215_B,00215,B,have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line
p00216_B,00216,B,oh yes certainly i will write directly
p00217_B,00217,B,indeed sir i am very sorry that mr crawford should continue to i know that it is paying me a very great compliment and i feel most undeservedly honoured but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told him so that it never will be in my power
p00218_B,00218,B,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that
p00219_B,00219,B,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps
p00220_B,00220,B,that play must be a favourite with you you read as if you knew it well
p00221_B,00221,B,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk
p00222_B,00222,B,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise
p00223_B,00223,B,no
p00224_B,00224,B,what did that shake of the head mean what was it meant to express disapprobation i fear but of what what had i been saying to displease you did you think me speaking improperly lightly irreverently on the subject only tell me if i was only tell me if i was wrong i want to be set right nay nay i entreat you for one moment put down your work what did that shake of the head mean
p00225_B,00225,B,how can you sir you quite astonish me i wonder how you can
p00226_B,00226,B,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend
p00227_B,00227,B,to be sure i had much rather she had stayed in harbour that i might have sat a few hours with you in comfort but as there is a boat ashore i had better go off at once and there is no help for it whereabouts does the thrush lay at spithead near the canopus but no matter here s fanny in the parlour and why should we stay in the passage come mother you have hardly looked at your own dear fanny yet
p00228_B,00228,B,ha that s just where i should have put her myself it s the best berth at spithead but here is my sister sir here is fanny it is so dark you do not see her
p00229_B,00229,B,her year i am sure i hope i shall be rid of her before she has staid a year for that will not be up till november servants are come to such a pass my dear in portsmouth that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year i have no hope of ever being settled and if i was to part with rebecca i should only get something worse and yet i do not think i am a very difficult mistress to please and i am sure the place is easy enough for there is always a girl under her and i often do half the work myself
p00230_B,00230,B,what have you got there my love come and shew it to me
p00231_B,00231,B,you have been here a month i think
p00232_B,00232,B,no not quite a month it is only four weeks to morrow since i left mansfield
p00233_B,00233,B,i wish you were not so tired i wish i left you in stronger health is there anything i can do for you in town i have half an idea of going into norfolk again soon i am not satisfied about maddison i am sure he still means to impose on me if possible and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill which i design for somebody else i must come to an understanding with him i must make him know that i will not be tricked on the south side of everingham any more than on the north that i will be master of my own property i was not explicit enough with him before the mischief such a man does on an estate both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor is inconceivable i have a great mind to go back into norfolk directly and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from maddison is a clever fellow i do not wish to displace him provided he does not try to displace me but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me and worse than simple to let him give me a hard hearted griping fellow for a tenant instead of an honest man to whom i have given half a promise already would it not be worse than simple shall i go do you advise it
p00234_B,00234,B,i advise you know very well what is right
p00235_B,00235,B,rushworth sir
p00236_B,00236,B,indeed i hope it is not true it would be so very shocking if i have spoken once to rebecca about that carpet i am sure i have spoke at least a dozen times have not i betsey and it would not be ten minutes work
p00237_B,00237,B,and what what could you say cruel quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty
