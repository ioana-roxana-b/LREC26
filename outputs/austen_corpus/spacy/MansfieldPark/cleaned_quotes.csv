Q0,i think we cannot do better let us send for the child,Lady Bertram,"['Sir Thomas', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q1,my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q2,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting,Sir Thomas,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q3,i thoroughly understand you you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q4,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us,Lady Bertram,"['Sir Thomas', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q5,then she had better come to us,Lady Bertram,"['Sir Thomas', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q6,yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companions of her own age and of a regular instructress,Sir Thomas,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q7,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q8,i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q9,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association,Sir Thomas,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q10,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q11,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone,Lady Bertram,"['Sir Thomas', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q12,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct,Sir Thomas,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q13,this is not a very promising beginning after all that i said to her as we came along i thought she would have behaved better i told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first i wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper her poor mother had a good deal but we must make allowances for such a child and i do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her for with all its faults it was her home and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better but then there is moderation in all things,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q14,my dear little cousin what can be the matter you are sorry to leave mama my dear little fanny which shows you to be a very good girl but you must remember that you are with relations and friends who all love you and wish to make you happy let us walk out in the park and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q15,no no not at all no thank you,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q16,william did not like she should come away he had told her he should miss her very much indeed,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q17,but william will write to you i dare say,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q18,yes he had promised he would but he had told her to write first,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q19,and when shall you do it,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q20,she did not know she had not any paper,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q21,if that be all your difficulty i will furnish you with paper and every other material and you may write your letter whenever you choose would it make you happy to write to william,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q22,yes very,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q23,then let it be done now come with me into the breakfast room we shall find everything there and be sure of having the room to ourselves,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q24,but cousin will it go to the post,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q25,yes depend upon me it shall it shall go with the other letters and as your uncle will frank it it will cost william nothing,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q26,my uncle,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q27,yes when you have written the letter i will take it to my father to frank,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q28,fanny was good natured enough,_unknowable,"['Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q29,dear mama only think my cousin cannot put the map of europe together or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in russia or she never heard of asia minor or she does not know the difference between water colours and crayons how strange did you ever hear anything so stupid,_unknowable,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q30,my dear it is very bad but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram']"
Q31,but aunt she is really so very ignorant do you know we asked her last night which way she would go to get to ireland and she said she should cross to the isle of wight she thinks of nothing but the isle of wight and she calls it the island as if there were no other island in the world i am sure i should have been ashamed of myself if i had not known better long before i was so old as she is i cannot remember the time when i did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet how long ago it is aunt since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of england with the dates of their accession and most of the principal events of their reigns,_unknowable,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q32,yes and of the roman emperors as low as severus besides a great deal of the heathen mythology and all the metals semi metals planets and distinguished philosophers,_unknowable,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q33,very true indeed my dears but you are blessed with wonderful memories and your poor cousin has probably none at all there is a vast deal of difference in memories as well as in everything else and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin and pity her deficiency and remember that if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves you should always be modest for much as you know already there is a great deal more for you to learn,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram']"
Q34,yes i know there is till i am seventeen but i must tell you another thing of fanny so odd and so stupid do you know she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing,_unknowable,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q35,to be sure my dear that is very stupid indeed and shows a great want of genius and emulation but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram']"
Q36,i blush for you tom i blush for the expedient which i am driven on and i trust i may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion you have robbed edmund for ten twenty thirty years perhaps for life of more than half the income which ought to be his it may hereafter be in my power or in yours i hope it will to procure him better preferment but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us and that nothing can in fact be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts,Sir Thomas,['Tom Bertram']
Q37,so fanny you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q38,going to leave you,Fanny Price,['Lady Bertram']
Q39,yes my dear why should you be astonished you have been five years with us and my sister always meant to take you when mr norris died but you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q40,i shall be very sorry to go away,Fanny Price,['Lady Bertram']
Q41,yes i dare say you will that s natural enough i suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q42,i hope i am not ungrateful aunt,Fanny Price,['Lady Bertram']
Q43,no my dear i hope not i have always found you a very good girl,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q44,and am i never to live here again,Fanny Price,['Lady Bertram']
Q45,never my dear but you are sure of a comfortable home it can make very little difference to you whether you are in one house or the other,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q46,cousin something is going to happen which i do not like at all and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that i disliked at first you will not be able to do it now i am going to live entirely with my aunt norris,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q47,indeed,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q48,yes my aunt bertram has just told me so it is quite settled i am to leave mansfield park and go to the white house i suppose as soon as she is removed there,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q49,well fanny and if the plan were not unpleasant to you i should call it an excellent one,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q50,oh cousin,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q51,it has everything else in its favour my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you she is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought and i am glad her love of money does not interfere you will be what you ought to be to her i hope it does not distress you very much fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q52,indeed it does i cannot like it i love this house and everything in it i shall love nothing there you know how uncomfortable i feel with her,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q53,i can say nothing for her manner to you as a child but it was the same with us all or nearly so she never knew how to be pleasant to children but you are now of an age to be treated better i think she is behaving better already and when you are her only companion you must be important to her,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q54,i can never be important to any one,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q55,what is to prevent you,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q56,everything my situation my foolishness and awkwardness,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q57,as to your foolishness and awkwardness my dear fanny believe me you never have a shadow of either but in using the words so improperly there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known you have good sense and a sweet temper and i am sure you have a grateful heart that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q58,you are too kind how shall i ever thank you as i ought for thinking so well of me oh cousin if i am to go away i shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q59,why indeed fanny i should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the white house you speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park but you will belong to us almost as much as ever the two families will be meeting every day in the year the only difference will be that living with your aunt you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be here there are too many whom you can hide behind but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q60,oh do not say so,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q61,i must say it and say it with pleasure mrs norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q62,i cannot see things as you do but i ought to believe you to be right rather than myself and i am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be if i could suppose my aunt really to care for me it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody here i know i am of none and yet i love the place so well,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q63,the place fanny is what you will not quit though you quit the house you will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change you will have the same walks to frequent the same library to choose from the same people to look at the same horse to ride,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q64,very true yes dear old grey pony ah cousin when i remember how much i used to dread riding what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good oh how i have trembled at my uncle s opening his lips if horses were talked of and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears and convince me that i should like it after a little while and feel how right you proved to be i am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q65,and i am quite convinced that your being with mrs norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health and as much for your ultimate happiness too,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q66,i think sister we need not keep miss lee any longer when fanny goes to live with you,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q67,live with me dear lady bertram what do you mean,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q68,is she not to live with you i thought you had settled it with sir thomas,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q69,me never i never spoke a syllable about it to sir thomas nor he to me fanny live with me the last thing in the world for me to think of or for anybody to wish that really knows us both good heaven what could i do with fanny me a poor helpless forlorn widow unfit for anything my spirits quite broke down what could i do with a girl at her time of life a girl of fifteen the very age of all others to need most attention and care and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test sure sir thomas could not seriously expect such a thing sir thomas is too much my friend nobody that wishes me well i am sure would propose it how came sir thomas to speak to you about it,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q70,indeed i do not know i suppose he thought it best,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q71,but what did he say he could not say he wished me to take fanny i am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q72,no he only said he thought it very likely and i thought so too we both thought it would be a comfort to you but if you do not like it there is no more to be said she is no encumbrance here,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q73,dear sister if you consider my unhappy state how can she be any comfort to me here am i a poor desolate widow deprived of the best of husbands my health gone in attending and nursing him my spirits still worse all my peace in this world destroyed with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed what possible comfort could i have in taking such a charge upon me as fanny if i could wish it for my own sake i would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl she is in good hands and sure of doing well i must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as i can,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q74,then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q75,lady bertram i do not complain i know i cannot live as i have done but i must retrench where i can and learn to be a better manager i have been a liberal housekeeper enough but i shall not be ashamed to practise economy now my situation is as much altered as my income a great many things were due from poor mr norris as clergyman of the parish that cannot be expected from me it is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers at the white house matters must be better looked after i must live within my income or i shall be miserable and i own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more to lay by a little at the end of the year,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q76,i dare say you will you always do don t you,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q77,my object lady bertram is to be of use to those that come after me it is for your children s good that i wish to be richer i have nobody else to care for but i should be very glad to think i could leave a little trifle among them worth their having,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q78,you are very good but do not trouble yourself about them they are sure of being well provided for sir thomas will take care of that,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q79,why you know sir thomas s means will be rather straitened if the antigua estate is to make such poor returns,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q80,oh that will soon be settled sir thomas has been writing about it i know,Lady Bertram,['Mrs. Norris']
Q81,well lady bertram i can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family and so if sir thomas should ever speak again about my taking fanny you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question besides that i really should not have a bed to give her for i must keep a spare room for a friend,Mrs. Norris,['Lady Bertram']
Q82,if william does come to mansfield i hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement though i fear he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q83,because she might ride one of her cousin s horses at any time when they did not want them,_unknowable,[]
Q84,fanny must have a horse,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q85,fanny must have a horse,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q86,if poor sir thomas were fated never to return it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear maria well married,Mrs. Norris,[]
Q87,if this man had not twelve thousand a year he would be a very stupid fellow,Edmund,[]
Q88,and now i have thought of something to make it complete i should dearly love to settle you both in this country and therefore henry you shall marry the youngest miss bertram a nice handsome good humoured accomplished girl who will make you very happy,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q89,my dear sister if you can persuade him into anything of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever and i shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a frenchwoman all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason coax or trick him into marrying is inconceivable he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined if your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke let them avoid henry,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q90,my dear brother i will not believe this of you,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q91,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift,Henry Crawford,"['Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q92,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q93,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q94,oh yes i am not at all ashamed of it i would have everybody marry if they can do it properly i do not like to have people throw themselves away but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q95,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls,Henry Crawford,"['Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q96,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q97,oh yes i like julia best,Henry Crawford,"['Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q98,but do you really for miss bertram is in general thought the handsomest,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q99,so i should suppose she has the advantage in every feature and i prefer her countenance but i like julia best miss bertram is certainly the handsomest and i have found her the most agreeable but i shall always like julia best because you order me,Henry Crawford,"['Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q100,i shall not talk to you henry but i know you will like her best at last,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q101,do not i tell you that i like her best at first,Henry Crawford,"['Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q102,and besides miss bertram is engaged remember that my dear brother her choice is made,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q103,yes and i like her the better for it an engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged she is satisfied with herself her cares are over and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion all is safe with a lady engaged no harm can be done,Henry Crawford,"['Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q104,why as to that mr rushworth is a very good sort of young man and it is a great match for her,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q105,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart,Henry Crawford,"['Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q106,mary how shall we manage him,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q107,we must leave him to himself i believe talking does no good he will be taken in at last,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q108,but i would not have him taken in i would not have him duped i would have it all fair and honourable,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q109,oh dear let him stand his chance and be taken in it will do just as well everybody is taken in at some period or other,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q110,not always in marriage dear mary,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q111,in marriage especially with all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married my dear mrs grant there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry look where i will i see that it is so and i feel that it must be so when i consider that it is of all transactions the one in which people expect most from others and are least honest themselves,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q112,ah you have been in a bad school for matrimony in hill street,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q113,my poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state but however speaking from my own observation it is a manoeuvring business i know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion or accomplishment or good quality in the person who have found themselves entirely deceived and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse what is this but a take in,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q114,my dear child there must be a little imagination here i beg your pardon but i cannot quite believe you depend upon it you see but half you see the evil but you do not see the consolation there will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere and we are all apt to expect too much but then if one scheme of happiness fails human nature turns to another if the first calculation is wrong we make a second better we find comfort somewhere and those evil minded observers dearest mary who make much of a little are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q115,well done sister i honour your esprit du corps when i am a wife i mean to be just as staunch myself and i wish my friends in general would be so too it would save me many a heartache,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q116,you are as bad as your brother mary but we will cure you both mansfield shall cure you both and without any taking in stay with us and we will cure you,Mrs. Grant,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q117,i begin now to understand you all except miss price pray is she out or is she not i am puzzled she dined at the parsonage with the rest of you which seemed like being out and yet she says so little that i can hardly suppose she is,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q118,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me,Edmund,"['Mary Crawford', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q119,and yet in general nothing can be more easily ascertained the distinction is so broad manners as well as appearance are generally speaking so totally different till now i could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl s being out or not a girl not out has always the same sort of dress a close bonnet for instance looks very demure and never says a word you may smile but it is so i assure you and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far it is all very proper girls should be quiet and modest the most objectionable part is that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden they sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite to confidence that is the faulty part of the present system one does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before mr bertram i dare say you have sometimes met with such changes,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q120,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson,Tom Bertram,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q121,no indeed miss anderson i do not know who or what you mean i am quite in the dark but i will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q122,ah you carry it off very well but i cannot be quite so far imposed on you must have had miss anderson in your eye in describing an altered young lady you paint too accurately for mistake it was exactly so the andersons of baker street we were speaking of them the other day you know edmund you have heard me mention charles anderson the circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it when anderson first introduced me to his family about two years ago his sister was not out and i could not get her to speak to me i sat there an hour one morning waiting for anderson with only her and a little girl or two in the room the governess being sick or run away and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business and i could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady nothing like a civil answer she screwed up her mouth and turned from me with such an air i did not see her again for a twelvemonth she was then out i met her at mrs holford s and did not recollect her she came up to me claimed me as an acquaintance stared me out of countenance and talked and laughed till i did not know which way to look i felt that i must be the jest of the room at the time and miss crawford it is plain has heard the story,Tom Bertram,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q123,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q124,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right,Tom Bertram,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q125,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards,Edmund,"['Mary Crawford', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q126,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q127,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me,Tom Bertram,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q128,that was bad indeed poor miss sneyd though i have no younger sister i feel for her to be neglected before one s time must be very vexatious but it was entirely the mother s fault miss augusta should have been with her governess such half and half doings never prosper but now i must be satisfied about miss price does she go to balls does she dine out every where as well as at my sister s,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q129,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her,Edmund,"['Mary Crawford', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q130,oh then the point is clear miss price is not out,Mary Crawford,"['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q131,i wish you could see compton it is the most complete thing i never saw a place so altered in my life i told smith i did not know where i was the approach now is one of the finest things in the country you see the house in the most surprising manner i declare when i got back to sotherton yesterday it looked like a prison quite a dismal old prison,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q132,oh for shame a prison indeed sotherton court is the noblest old place in the world,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q133,it wants improvement ma am beyond anything i never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life and it is so forlorn that i do not know what can be done with it,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q134,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire,Mrs. Grant,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q135,i must try to do something with it but i do not know what i hope i shall have some good friend to help me,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q136,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q137,that is what i was thinking of as he has done so well by smith i think i had better have him at once his terms are five guineas a day,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q138,well and if they were ten,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q139,i am sure you need not regard it the expense need not be any impediment if i were you i should not think of the expense i would have everything done in the best style and made as nice as possible such a place as sotherton court deserves everything that taste and money can do you have space to work upon there and grounds that will well reward you for my own part if i had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of sotherton i should be always planting and improving for naturally i am excessively fond of it it would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where i am now with my little half acre it would be quite a burlesque but if i had more room i should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting we did a vast deal in that way at the parsonage we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it you young ones do not remember much about it perhaps but if dear sir thomas were here he could tell you what improvements we made and a great deal more would have been done but for poor mr norris s sad state of health he could hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything and that disheartened me from doing several things that sir thomas and i used to talk of if it had not been for that we should have carried on the garden wall and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard just as dr grant has done we were always doing something as it was it was only the spring twelvemonth before mr norris s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall which is now grown such a noble tree and getting to such perfection sir,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q140,the tree thrives well beyond a doubt madam the soil is good and i never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering,Dr. Grant,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q141,sir it is a moor park we bought it as a moor park and it cost us that is it was a present from sir thomas but i saw the bill and i know it cost seven shillings and was charged as a moor park,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q142,you were imposed on ma am these potatoes have as much the flavour of a moor park apricot as the fruit from that tree it is an insipid fruit at the best but a good apricot is eatable which none from my garden are,Dr. Grant,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q143,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all,Mrs. Grant,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q144,smith s place is the admiration of all the country and it was a mere nothing before repton took it in hand i think i shall have repton,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q145,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather,Lady Bertram,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q146,smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds which is little enough and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved now at sotherton we have a good seven hundred without reckoning the water meadows so that i think if so much could be done at compton we need not despair there have been two or three fine old trees cut down that grew too near the house and it opens the prospect amazingly which makes me think that repton or anybody of that sort would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill you know,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q147,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q148,cut down an avenue what a pity does it not make you think of cowper ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q149,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q150,i should like to see sotherton before it is cut down to see the place as it is now in its old state but i do not suppose i shall,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q151,have you never been there no you never can and unluckily it is out of distance for a ride i wish we could contrive it,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q152,oh it does not signify whenever i do see it you will tell me how it has been altered,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q153,i collect that sotherton is an old place and a place of some grandeur in any particular style of building,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q154,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q155,he is a well bred man he makes the best of it,Mary Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q156,i do not wish to influence mr rushworth but had i a place to new fashion i should not put myself into the hands of an improver i would rather have an inferior degree of beauty of my own choice and acquired progressively i would rather abide by my own blunders than by his,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q157,you would know what you were about of course but that would not suit me i have no eye or ingenuity for such matters but as they are before me and had i a place of my own in the country i should be most thankful to any mr repton who would undertake it and give me as much beauty as he could for my money and i should never look at it till it was complete,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q158,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q159,ay you have been brought up to it it was no part of my education and the only dose i ever had being administered by not the first favourite in the world has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances three years ago the admiral my honoured uncle bought a cottage at twickenham for us all to spend our summers in and my aunt and i went down to it quite in raptures but it being excessively pretty it was soon found necessary to be improved and for three months we were all dirt and confusion without a gravel walk to step on or a bench fit for use i would have everything as complete as possible in the country shrubberies and flower gardens and rustic seats innumerable but it must all be done without my care henry is different he loves to be doing,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q160,mr bertram i have tidings of my harp at last i am assured that it is safe at northampton and there it has probably been these ten days in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q161,the truth is that our inquiries were too direct we sent a servant we went ourselves this will not do seventy miles from london but this morning we heard of it in the right way it was seen by some farmer and he told the miller and the miller told the butcher and the butcher s son in law left word at the shop,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q162,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q163,i am to have it to morrow but how do you think it is to be conveyed not by a wagon or cart oh no nothing of that kind could be hired in the village i might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q164,you would find it difficult i dare say just now in the middle of a very late hay harvest to hire a horse and cart,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q165,i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible so i told my maid to speak for one directly and as i cannot look out of my dressing closet without seeing one farmyard nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another i thought it would be only ask and have and was rather grieved that i could not give the advantage to all guess my surprise when i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable most impossible thing in the world had offended all the farmers all the labourers all the hay in the parish as for dr grant s bailiff i believe i had better keep out of his way and my brother in law himself who is all kindness in general looked rather black upon me when he found what i had been at,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q166,you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before but when you do think of it you must see the importance of getting in the grass the hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out but in harvest it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q167,i shall understand all your ways in time but coming down with the true london maxim that everything is to be got with money i was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs however i am to have my harp fetched to morrow henry who is good nature itself has offered to fetch it in his barouche will it not be honourably conveyed,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q168,i shall be most happy to play to you both at least as long as you can like to listen probably much longer for i dearly love music myself and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off for she is gratified in more ways than one now mr bertram if you write to your brother i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come he heard so much of my misery about it and you may say if you please that i shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return in compassion to his feelings as i know his horse will lose,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q169,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q170,no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the fewest possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be who loves me consults me confides in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and everything as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style that is a complete brother s letter,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q171,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q172,miss price has a brother at sea whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q173,at sea has she in the king s service of course,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q174,do you know anything of my cousin s captain captain marshall you have a large acquaintance in the navy i conclude,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q175,among admirals large enough but,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q176,we know very little of the inferior ranks post captains may be very good sort of men but they do not belong to us of various admirals i could tell you a great deal of them and their flags and the gradation of their pay and their bickerings and jealousies but in general i can assure you that they are all passed over and all very ill used certainly my home at my uncle s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals of rears and vices i saw enough now do not be suspecting me of a pun i entreat,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q177,it is a noble profession,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q178,yes the profession is well enough under two circumstances if it make the fortune and there be discretion in spending it but in short it is not a favourite profession of mine it has never worn an amiable form to me,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q179,my dear henry have you nothing to say you have been an improver yourself and from what i hear of everingham it may vie with any place in england its natural beauties i am sure are great everingham as it used to be was perfect in my estimation such a happy fall of ground and such timber what would i not give to see it again,Mrs. Grant,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q180,nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it but i fear there would be some disappointment you would not find it equal to your present ideas in extent it is a mere nothing you would be surprised at its insignificance and as for improvement there was very little for me to do too little i should like to have been busy much longer,Henry Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q181,you are fond of the sort of thing,Julia Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q182,excessively but what with the natural advantages of the ground which pointed out even to a very young eye what little remained to be done and my own consequent resolutions i had not been of age three months before everingham was all that it is now my plan was laid at westminster a little altered perhaps at cambridge and at one and twenty executed i am inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him i have been a devourer of my own,Henry Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q183,those who see quickly will resolve quickly and act quickly you can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth you should assist him with your opinion,Julia Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q184,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q185,well fanny and how do you like miss crawford now how did you like her yesterday,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q186,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q187,it is her countenance that is so attractive she has a wonderful play of feature but was there nothing in her conversation that struck you fanny as not quite right,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q188,oh yes she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did i was quite astonished an uncle with whom she has been living so many years and who whatever his faults may be is so very fond of her brother treating him they say quite like a son i could not have believed it,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q189,i thought you would be struck it was very wrong very indecorous,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q190,and very ungrateful i think,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q191,ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt s memory which misleads her here she is awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs crawford without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements though the admiral s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely i do not censure her opinions but there certainly is impropriety in making them public,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q192,do not you think that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon mrs crawford as her niece has been entirely brought up by her she cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the admiral,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q193,that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q194,yes except as to his writing her such short letters she made me almost laugh but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters when they are separated i am sure william would never have used me so under any circumstances and what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q195,the right of a lively mind fanny seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others perfectly allowable when untinctured by ill humour or roughness and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of miss crawford nothing sharp or loud or coarse she is perfectly feminine except in the instances we have been speaking of there she cannot be justified i am glad you saw it all as i did,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q196,my dear miss price i am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting but i have nothing in the world to say for myself i knew it was very late and that i was behaving extremely ill and therefore if you please you must forgive me selfishness must always be forgiven you know because there is no hope of a cure,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q197,for there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner clouds are now coming up and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then i wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise i wish you had saved yourself this walk home,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q198,no part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse i assure you i am very strong nothing ever fatigues me but doing what i do not like miss price i give way to you with a very bad grace but i sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride and that i may have nothing but good to hear of this dear delightful beautiful animal,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q199,it is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding i never see one sit a horse better she did not seem to have a thought of fear very different from you miss when you first began six years ago come next easter lord bless you how you did tremble when sir thomas first had you put on,The Old Coachman,['Fanny Price']
Q200,i was sure she would ride well she has the make for it her figure is as neat as her brother s,Julia Bertram,['Maria Bertram']
Q201,yes and her spirits are as good and she has the same energy of character i cannot but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind,Maria Bertram,['Julia Bertram']
Q202,no i do not know not if you want the mare,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q203,i do not want her at all for myself but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home i think miss crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mansfield common mrs grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any morning will do for this she would be extremely sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q204,i shall not ride to morrow certainly i have been out very often lately and would rather stay at home you know i am strong enough now to walk very well,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q205,but where is fanny is she gone to bed,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q206,no not that i know of she was here a moment ago,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q207,that is a very foolish trick fanny to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have no work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new calico that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q208,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house,Julia Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q209,fanny i am sure you have the headache,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q210,i can hardly believe you i know your looks too well how long have you had it,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q211,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q212,did you go out in the heat,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q213,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q214,yes indeed edmund i was out above an hour i sat three quarters of an hour in the flower garden while fanny cut the roses and very pleasant it was i assure you but very hot it was shady enough in the alcove but i declare i quite dreaded the coming home again,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q215,fanny has been cutting roses has she,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q216,yes and i am afraid they will be the last this year poor thing she found it hot enough but they were so full blown that one could not wait,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q217,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q218,she has got it she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q219,what has she been walking as well as cutting roses walking across the hot park to your house and doing it twice ma am no wonder her head aches,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q220,i was afraid it would be too much for her but when the roses were gathered your aunt wished to have them and then you know they must be taken home,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q221,but were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price']"
Q222,no but they were to be put into the spare room to dry and unluckily fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key so she was obliged to go again,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q223,and could nobody be employed on such an errand but fanny upon my word ma am it has been a very ill managed business,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price']"
Q224,i am sure i do not know how it was to have been done better unless i had gone myself indeed but i cannot be in two places at once and i was talking to mr green at that very time about your mother s dairymaid by her desire and had promised john groom to write to mrs jefferies about his son and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour i think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion but really i cannot do everything at once and as for fanny s just stepping down to my house for me it is not much above a quarter of a mile i cannot think i was unreasonable to ask it how often do i pace it three times a day early and late ay and in all weathers too and say nothing about it,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q225,i wish fanny had half your strength ma am,Edmund,['Mrs. Norris']
Q226,if fanny would be more regular in her exercise she would not be knocked up so soon she has not been out on horseback now this long while and i am persuaded that when she does not ride she ought to walk if she had been riding before i should not have asked it of her but i thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind and though the sun was strong it was not so very hot between ourselves edmund,Mrs. Norris,['Edmund']
Q227,it was cutting the roses and dawdling about in the flower garden that did the mischief,Mrs. Norris,['Edmund']
Q228,i am afraid it was indeed i am very much afraid she caught the headache there for the heat was enough to kill anybody it was as much as i could bear myself sitting and calling to pug and trying to keep him from the flower beds was almost too much for me,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q229,the fatigue would be too much for my sister a great deal too much i assure you my dear mrs rushworth ten miles there and ten back you know you must excuse my sister on this occasion and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her sotherton is the only place that could give her a wish to go so far but it cannot be indeed she will have a companion in fanny price you know so it will all do very well and as for edmund as he is not here to speak for himself i will answer for his being most happy to join the party he can go on horseback you know,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q230,the loss of her ladyship s company would be a great drawback and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at sotherton yet and it was a pity she should not see the place,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q231,you are very kind you are all kindness my dear madam but as to fanny she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing sotherton she has time enough before her and her going now is quite out of the question lady bertram could not possibly spare her,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q232,oh no i cannot do without fanny,Lady Bertram,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q233,but why is it necessary that crawford s carriage or his only should be employed why is no use to be made of my mother s chaise i could not when the scheme was first mentioned the other day understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q234,what go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather when we may have seats in a barouche no my dear edmund that will not quite do,Julia Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q235,besides i know that mr crawford depends upon taking us after what passed at first he would claim it as a promise,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q236,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q237,that would not be a very handsome reason for using mr crawford s but the truth is that wilcox is a stupid old fellow and does not know how to drive i will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on wednesday,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q238,there is no hardship i suppose nothing unpleasant in going on the barouche box,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q239,unpleasant oh dear i believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat there can be no comparison as to one s view of the country probably miss crawford will choose the barouche box herself,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q240,there can be no objection then to fanny s going with you there can be no doubt of your having room for her,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q241,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q242,you can have no reason i imagine madam for wishing fanny not to be of the party but as it relates to yourself to your own comfort if you could do without her you would not wish to keep her at home,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q243,to be sure not but i cannot do without her,Lady Bertram,"['Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q244,you can if i stay at home with you as i mean to do,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q245,yes there is no necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home fanny has a great desire to see sotherton i know she wishes it very much she has not often a gratification of the kind and i am sure ma am you would be glad to give her the pleasure now,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q246,oh yes very glad if your aunt sees no objection,Lady Bertram,"['Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q247,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q248,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q249,i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,Julia Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q250,fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q251,as there are five of you it will be better that one should sit with henry and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive julia i think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson,Mrs. Grant,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q252,here is a fine burst of country i wish you had my seat but i dare say you will not take it let me press you ever so much,Julia Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q253,now we shall have no more rough road miss crawford our difficulties are over the rest of the way is such as it ought to be mr rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate here begins the village those cottages are really a disgrace the church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome i am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places the annoyance of the bells must be terrible there is the parsonage a tidy looking house and i understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people those are almshouses built by some of the family to the right is the steward s house he is a very respectable man now we are coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still it is not ugly you see at this end there is some fine timber but the situation of the house is dreadful we go down hill to it for half a mile and it is a pity for it would not be an ill looking place if it had a better approach,Maria Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q254,now where is the avenue the house fronts the east i perceive the avenue therefore must be at the back of it mr rushworth talked of the west front,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q255,yes it is exactly behind the house begins at a little distance and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds you may see something of it here something of the more distant trees it is oak entirely,Maria Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q256,now we are coming to the chapel which properly we ought to enter from above and look down upon but as we are quite among friends i will take you in this way if you will excuse me,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q257,i am disappointed,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q258,this is not my idea of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no aisles no arches no inscriptions no banners no banners cousin to be blown by the night wind of heaven no signs that a,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q259,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q260,it was foolish of me not to think of all that but i am disappointed,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q261,this chapel was fitted up as you see it in james the second s time before that period as i understand the pews were only wainscot and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth but this is not quite certain it is a handsome chapel and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain within the memory of many but the late mr rushworth left it off,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q262,every generation has its improvements,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q263,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q264,very fine indeed it must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure and say their prayers here twice a day while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q265,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q266,at any rate it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects everybody likes to go their own way to chuse their own time and manner of devotion the obligation of attendance the formality the restraint the length of time altogether it is a formidable thing and what nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed when they woke with a headache without danger of reprobation because chapel was missed they would have jumped with joy and envy cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel the young mrs eleanors and mrs bridgets starched up into seeming piety but with heads full of something very different especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at and in those days i fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q267,your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects you have given us an amusing sketch and human nature cannot say it was not so we must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish but if you are supposing it a frequent thing that is to say a weakness grown into a habit from neglect what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons do you think the minds which are suffered which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel would be more collected in a closet,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q268,yes very likely they would have two chances at least in their favour there would be less to distract the attention from without and it would not be tried so long,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q269,the mind which does not struggle against itself under one circumstance would find objects to distract it in the other i believe and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with the greater length of the service however i admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind one wishes it were not so but i have not yet left oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q270,do look at mr rushworth and maria standing side by side exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed have not they completely the air of it,Julia Bertram,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q271,i do not like to see miss bertram so near the altar,Henry Crawford,['Maria Bertram']
Q272,if he would give her away,Maria Bertram,['Henry Crawford']
Q273,i am afraid i should do it very awkwardly,Henry Crawford,['Maria Bertram']
Q274,upon my word it is really a pity that it should not take place directly if we had but a proper licence for here we are altogether and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant,Julia Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q275,if edmund were but in orders,Julia Bertram,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q276,my dear edmund if you were but in orders now you might perform the ceremony directly how unlucky that you are not ordained mr rushworth and maria are quite ready,Julia Bertram,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q277,how distressed she will be at what she said just now,Fanny Price,[]
Q278,ordained what are you to be a clergyman,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q279,yes i shall take orders soon after my father s return probably at christmas,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q280,if i had known this before i would have spoken of the cloth with more respect,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q281,for if we are too long going over the house we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors it is past two and we are to dine at five,Mr. Rushworth,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q282,suppose we turn down here for the present here are the greatest number of our plants and here are the curious pheasants,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q283,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn,Henry Crawford,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q284,james i believe the wilderness will be new to all the party the miss bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q285,this is insufferably hot shall any of us object to being comfortable here is a nice little wood if one can but get into it what happiness if the door should not be locked but of course it is for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q286,so you are to be a clergyman mr bertram this is rather a surprise to me,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q287,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q288,very true but in short it had not occurred to me and you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q289,a very praiseworthy practice but not quite universal i am one of the exceptions and being one must do something for myself,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q290,but why are you to be a clergyman i thought that was always the lot of the youngest where there were many to chuse before him,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q291,do you think the church itself never chosen then,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q292,never is a black word but yes in the never of conversation which means not very often i do think it for what is to be done in the church men love to distinguish themselves and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained but not in the church a clergyman is nothing,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q293,the nothing of conversation has its gradations i hope as well as the never a clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion he must not head mobs or set the ton in dress but i cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind individually or collectively considered temporally and eternally which has the guardianship of religion and morals and consequently of the manners which result from their influence no one here can call the office nothing if the man who holds it is so it is by the neglect of his duty by foregoing its just importance and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q294,you assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given or than i can quite comprehend one does not see much of this influence and importance in society and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves how can two sermons a week even supposing them worth hearing supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer blair s to his own do all that you speak of govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q295,you are speaking of london i am speaking of the nation at large,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q296,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q297,not i should hope of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom we do not look in great cities for our best morality it is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt a fine preacher is followed and admired but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character and observing his general conduct which in london can rarely be the case the clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners they are known to the largest part only as preachers and with regard to their influencing public manners miss crawford must not misunderstand me or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulators of refinement and courtesy the masters of the ceremonies of life the manners i speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps the result of good principles the effect in short of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i believe be everywhere found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to be so are the rest of the nation,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q298,certainly,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q299,there you have quite convinced miss price already,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q300,i wish i could convince miss crawford too,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q301,i do not think you ever will,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q302,i am just as much surprised now as i was at first that you should intend to take orders you really are fit for something better come do change your mind it is not too late go into the law,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q303,go into the law with as much ease as i was told to go into this wilderness,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q304,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q305,you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot for there is not the least wit in my nature i am a very matter of fact plain spoken being and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q306,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q307,my dear fanny how thoughtless i have been i hope you are not very tired perhaps my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q308,thank you but i am not at all tired,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q309,you scarcely touch me you do not make me of any use what a difference in the weight of a woman s arm from that of a man at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only a fly in the comparison,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q310,i am really not tired which i almost wonder at for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood do not you think we have,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q311,not half a mile,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q312,oh you do not consider how much we have wound about we have taken such a very serpentine course and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q313,but if you remember before we left that first great path we saw directly to the end of it we looked down the whole vista and saw it closed by iron gates and it could not have been more than a furlong in length,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q314,oh i know nothing of your furlongs but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it and therefore when i say that we have walked a mile in it i must speak within compass,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q315,we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here do you think we are walking four miles an hour,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q316,oh do not attack me with your watch a watch is always too fast or too slow i cannot be dictated to by a watch,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q317,i am afraid you are very tired fanny why would not you speak sooner this will be a bad day s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon miss crawford except riding,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q318,how abominable in you then to let me engross her horse as i did all last week i am ashamed of you and of myself but it shall never happen again,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q319,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q320,that she should be tired now however gives me no surprise for there is nothing in the course of one s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning seeing a great house dawdling from one room to another straining one s eyes and one s attention hearing what one does not understand admiring what one does not care for it is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world and miss price has found it so though she did not know it,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q321,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q322,i must move resting fatigues me i have looked across the ha ha till i am weary i must go and look through that iron gate at the same view without being able to see it so well,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q323,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q324,it is an immense distance i see that with a glance,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q325,miss price all alone,_unknowable,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q326,my dear fanny how comes this,_unknowable,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q327,poor dear fanny how ill you have been used by them you had better have staid with us,Maria Bertram,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q328,it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are so far from the house already,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q329,yes there is nothing else to be done but now sincerely do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q330,no indeed far otherwise i find it better grander more complete in its style though that style may not be the best and to tell you the truth,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q331,i do not think that i shall ever see sotherton again with so much pleasure as i do now another summer will hardly improve it to me,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q332,you are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world if other people think sotherton improved i have no doubt that you will,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q333,i am afraid i am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points my feelings are not quite so evanescent nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q334,you seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning i was glad to see you so well entertained you and julia were laughing the whole way,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q335,were we yes i believe we were but i have not the least recollection at what oh i believe i was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old irish groom of my uncle s your sister loves to laugh,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q336,you think her more light hearted than i am,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q337,more easily amused consequently you know better company i could not have hoped to entertain you with irish anecdotes during a ten miles drive,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q338,naturally i believe i am as lively as julia but i have more to think of now,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q339,you have undoubtedly and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility your prospects however are too fair to justify want of spirits you have a very smiling scene before you,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q340,do you mean literally or figuratively literally i conclude yes certainly the sun shines and the park looks very cheerful but unluckily that iron gate that ha ha give me a feeling of restraint and hardship i cannot get out as the starling said,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q341,mr rushworth is so long fetching this key,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q342,and for the world you would not get out without the key and without mr rushworth s authority and protection or i think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate here with my assistance i think it might be done if you really wished to be more at large and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q343,prohibited nonsense i certainly can get out that way and i will mr rushworth will be here in a moment you know we shall not be out of sight,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q344,or if we are miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll the grove of oak on the knoll,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q345,you will hurt yourself miss bertram you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes you will tear your gown you will be in danger of slipping into the ha ha you had better not go,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q346,thank you my dear fanny but i and my gown are alive and well and so good bye,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q347,heyday where are the others i thought maria and mr crawford were with you,Julia Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q348,a pretty trick upon my word i cannot see them anywhere,Julia Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q349,but they cannot be very far off and i think i am equal to as much as maria even without help,Julia Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q350,but julia mr rushworth will be here in a moment with the key do wait for mr rushworth,Fanny Price,['Julia Bertram']
Q351,not i indeed i have had enough of the family for one morning why child i have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother such a penance as i have been enduring while you were sitting here so composed and so happy it might have been as well perhaps if you had been in my place but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes,Julia Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q352,yes yes we saw him he was posting away as if upon life and death and could but just spare time to tell us his errand and where you all were,Julia Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q353,it is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing,Fanny Price,['Julia Bertram']
Q354,that is miss maria s concern i am not obliged to punish myself for her sins the mother i could not avoid as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper but the son i can get away from,Julia Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q355,they desired me to stay my cousin maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll or thereabouts,Fanny Price,['Mr. Rushworth']
Q356,i do not believe i shall go any farther i see nothing of them by the time i get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else i have had walking enough,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q357,i am very sorry it is very unlucky,Fanny Price,['Mr. Rushworth']
Q358,i think they might as well have staid for me,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q359,miss bertram thought you would follow her,Fanny Price,['Mr. Rushworth']
Q360,i should not have had to follow her if she had staid,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q361,pray miss price are you such a great admirer of this mr crawford as some people are for my part i can see nothing in him,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q362,i do not think him at all handsome,Fanny Price,['Mr. Rushworth']
Q363,handsome nobody can call such an undersized man handsome he is not five foot nine i should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight i think he is an ill looking fellow in my opinion these crawfords are no addition at all we did very well without them,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q364,if i had made any difficulty about fetching the key there might have been some excuse but i went the very moment she said she wanted it,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q365,nothing could be more obliging than your manner i am sure and i dare say you walked as fast as you could but still it is some distance you know from this spot to the house quite into the house and when people are waiting they are bad judges of time and every half minute seems like five,Fanny Price,['Mr. Rushworth']
Q366,it is a pity you should not join them they expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park and will be thinking how it may be improved and nothing of that sort you know can be settled without you,Fanny Price,['Mr. Rushworth']
Q367,well if you really think i had better go it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q368,i hope i am not to lose my companion unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat,Henry Crawford,['Julia Bertram']
Q369,well fanny this has been a fine day for you upon my word nothing but pleasure from beginning to end i am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt bertram and me for contriving to let you go a pretty good day s amusement you have had,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q370,i think you have done pretty well yourself ma am your lap seems full of good things and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully,Maria Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q371,my dear it is only a beautiful little heath which that nice old gardener would make me take but if it is in your way i will have it in my lap directly there fanny you shall carry that parcel for me take great care of it do not let it fall it is a cream cheese just like the excellent one we had at dinner nothing would satisfy that good old mrs whitaker but my taking one of the cheeses i stood out as long as i could till the tears almost came into her eyes and i knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with that mrs whitaker is a treasure she was quite shocked when i asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns take care of the cheese fanny now i can manage the other parcel and the basket very well,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q372,what else have you been spunging,Maria Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q373,spunging my dear it is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants eggs which mrs whitaker would quite force upon me she would not take a denial she said it must be such an amusement to me as she understood i lived quite alone to have a few living creatures of that sort and so to be sure it will i shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen and if they come to good i can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them and if i have good luck your mother shall have some,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q374,how happy mr rushworth looks he is thinking of november,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q375,your father s return will be a very interesting event,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q376,it will indeed after such an absence an absence not only long but including so many dangers,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q377,it will be the forerunner also of other interesting events your sister s marriage and your taking orders,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q378,yes,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q379,don t be affronted but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes who after performing great exploits in a foreign land offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q380,there is no sacrifice in the case it is entirely her own doing,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q381,oh yes i know it is i was merely joking she has done no more than what every young woman would do and i have no doubt of her being extremely happy my other sacrifice of course you do not understand,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q382,my taking orders i assure you is quite as voluntary as maria s marrying,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q383,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q384,which you suppose has biassed me,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q385,but that i am sure it has not,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q386,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q387,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q388,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q389,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q390,what take orders without a living no that is madness indeed absolute madness,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q391,shall i ask you how the church is to be filled if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without no for you certainly would not know what to say but i must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument as he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession as heroism and noise and fashion are all against him he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q392,oh no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made to the trouble of working for one and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat drink and grow fat it is indolence mr bertram indeed indolence and love of ease a want of all laudable ambition of taste for good company or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable which make men clergymen a clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish read the newspaper watch the weather and quarrel with his wife his curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q393,there are such clergymen no doubt but i think they are not so common as to justify miss crawford in esteeming it their general character i suspect that in this comprehensive and may i say commonplace censure you are not judging from yourself but from prejudiced persons whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing it is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy you can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively you are speaking what you have been told at your uncle s table,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q394,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q395,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q396,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q397,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q398,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q399,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman,Fanny Price,"['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q400,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q401,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q402,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q403,there goes good humour i am sure,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q404,there goes a temper which would never give pain how well she walks and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others joining them the moment she is asked what a pity that she should have been in such hands,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q405,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q406,i like to hear your enthusiasm fanny it is a lovely night and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel in some degree as you do who have not at least been given a taste for nature in early life they lose a great deal,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q407,you taught me to think and feel on the subject cousin,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q408,i had a very apt scholar there s arcturus looking very bright,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q409,yes and the bear i wish i could see cassiopeia,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q410,we must go out on the lawn for that should you be afraid,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q411,not in the least it is a great while since we have had any star gazing,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q412,yes i do not know how it has happened,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q413,we will stay till this is finished fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q414,i am rather surprised that mr crawford should come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven weeks for i had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone to take him elsewhere he is used to much gayer places than mansfield,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q415,it is to his credit and i dare say it gives his sister pleasure she does not like his unsettled habits,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q416,what a favourite he is with my cousins,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q417,yes his manners to women are such as must please mrs grant i believe suspects him of a preference for julia i have never seen much symptom of it but i wish it may be so he has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q418,if miss bertram were not engaged i could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than julia,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q419,which is perhaps more in favour of his liking julia best than you fanny may be aware for i believe it often happens that a man before he has quite made up his own mind will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from maria and i am not at all afraid for her after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q420,i think ma am we shall see some happy faces again now,Mrs. Norris,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price']"
Q421,yes ma am indeed there will be some satisfaction in looking on now and i think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms i wonder my son did not propose it,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q422,i dare say he did ma am mr rushworth is never remiss but dear maria has such a strict sense of propriety so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays mrs rushworth that wish of avoiding particularity dear ma am only look at her face at this moment how different from what it was the two last dances,Mrs. Norris,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price']"
Q423,it is quite delightful ma am to see young people so properly happy so well suited and so much the thing i cannot but think of dear sir thomas s delight and what do you say ma am to the chance of another match mr rushworth has set a good example and such things are very catching,Mrs. Norris,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price']"
Q424,the couple above ma am do you see no symptoms there,Mrs. Norris,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price']"
Q425,oh dear miss julia and mr crawford yes indeed a very pretty match what is his property,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q426,four thousand a year,Mrs. Norris,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price']"
Q427,very well those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have four thousand a year is a pretty estate and he seems a very genteel steady young man so i hope miss julia will be very happy,Mrs. Rushworth,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q428,it is not a settled thing ma am yet we only speak of it among friends but i have very little doubt it will be he is growing extremely particular in his attentions,Mrs. Norris,"['Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price']"
Q429,if you want to dance fanny i will stand up with you,Tom Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q430,i am glad of it for i am tired to death i only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long they had need be all in love to find any amusement in such folly and so they are i fancy if you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers all but yates and mrs grant and between ourselves she poor woman must want a lover as much as any one of them a desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor,Tom Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q431,a strange business this in america dr grant what is your opinion i always come to you to know what i am to think of public matters,Tom Bertram,"['Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q432,my dear tom as you are not dancing i dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber shall you,Mrs. Norris,"['Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q433,we want to make a table for mrs rushworth you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him,Mrs. Norris,['Tom Bertram']
Q434,i should be most happy it would give me the greatest pleasure but that i am this moment going to dance come fanny do not be dawdling any longer or the dance will be over,Tom Bertram,"['Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q435,a pretty modest request upon my word to want to nail me to a card table for the next two hours with herself and dr grant who are always quarrelling and that poking old woman who knows no more of whist than of algebra i wish my good aunt would be a little less busy and to ask me in such a way too without ceremony before them all so as to leave me no possibility of refusing that is what i dislike most particularly it raises my spleen more than anything to have the pretence of being asked of being given a choice and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing whatever it be if i had not luckily thought of standing up with you i could not have got out of it it is a great deal too bad but when my aunt has got a fancy in her head nothing can stop her,Tom Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q436,a trifling part and not at all to my taste and such a one as i certainly would not accept again but i was determined to make no difficulties lord ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before i reached ecclesford and though lord ravenshaw offered to resign his to me it was impossible to take it you know i was sorry for him that he should have so mistaken his powers for he was no more equal to the baron a little man with a weak voice always hoarse after the first ten minutes it must have injured the piece materially but i was resolved to make no difficulties sir henry thought the duke not equal to frederick but that was because sir henry wanted the part himself whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two i was surprised to see sir henry such a stick luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him our agatha was inimitable and the duke was thought very great by many and upon the whole it would certainly have gone off wonderfully,Mr. Yates,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q437,it was a hard case upon my word,_unknowable,"['Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q438,i do think you were very much to be pitied,_unknowable,"['Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q439,it is not worth complaining about but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted it was but three days and being only a grandmother and all happening two hundred miles off i think there would have been no great harm and it was suggested i know but lord ravenshaw who i suppose is one of the most correct men in england would not hear of it,Mr. Yates,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q440,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager,Tom Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q441,oh for the ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with,Mr. Yates,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q442,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q443,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough,Tom Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q444,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more,Mr. Yates,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q445,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery,Maria Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q446,nay let us do nothing by halves if we are to act let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit boxes and gallery and let us have a play entire from beginning to end so as it be a german play no matter what with a good tricking shifting afterpiece and a figure dance and a hornpipe and a song between the acts if we do not outdo ecclesford we do nothing,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q447,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one,Julia Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q448,true to see real acting good hardened real acting but i would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade a set of gentlemen and ladies who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q449,such a horribly vile billiard table as ours is not to be met with i believe above ground i can stand it no longer and i think i may say that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again but one good thing i have just ascertained it is the very room for a theatre precisely the shape and length for it and the doors at the farther end communicating with each other as they may be made to do in five minutes by merely moving the bookcase in my father s room is the very thing we could have desired if we had sat down to wish for it and my father s room will be an excellent greenroom it seems to join the billiard room on purpose,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q450,you are not serious tom in meaning to act,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q451,not serious never more so i assure you what is there to surprise you in it,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q452,i think it would be very wrong in a general light private theatricals are open to some objections but as we are circumstanced i must think it would be highly injudicious and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind it would shew great want of feeling on my father s account absent as he is and in some degree of constant danger and it would be imprudent i think with regard to maria whose situation is a very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q453,you take up a thing so seriously as if we were going to act three times a week till my father s return and invite all the country but it is not to be a display of that sort we mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves just to vary the scene and exercise our powers in something new we want no audience no publicity we may be trusted i think in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable and i can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own i have no fears and no scruples and as to my father s being absent it is so far from an objection that i consider it rather as a motive for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks i shall think our time very well spent and so i am sure will he it is a very anxious period for her,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q454,by jove this won t do to be sure my dear mother your anxiety i was unlucky there,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q455,what is the matter i was not asleep,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q456,oh dear no ma am nobody suspected you well edmund,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q457,but this i will maintain that we shall be doing no harm,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q458,i cannot agree with you i am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q459,and i am convinced to the contrary nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people or promotes it more than my father and for anything of the acting spouting reciting kind i think he has always a decided taste i am sure he encouraged it in us as boys how many a time have we mourned over the dead body of julius caesar and to be d and not to be d in this very room for his amusement and i am sure my name was norval every evening of my life through one christmas holidays,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q460,it was a very different thing you must see the difference yourself my father wished us as schoolboys to speak well but he would never wish his grown up daughters to be acting plays his sense of decorum is strict,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q461,i know all that i know my father as well as you do and i ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him manage your own concerns edmund and i ll take care of the rest of the family,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q462,if you are resolved on acting i must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way and i think a theatre ought not to be attempted it would be taking liberties with my father s house in his absence which could not be justified,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q463,for everything of that nature i will be answerable his house shall not be hurt i have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have and as to such alterations as i was suggesting just now such as moving a bookcase or unlocking a door or even as using the billiard room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room and less in the breakfast room than we did before he went away or to my sister s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other absolute nonsense,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q464,the innovation if not wrong as an innovation will be wrong as an expense,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q465,yes the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly but it will be on the simplest plan a green curtain and a little carpenter s work and that s all and as the carpenter s work may be all done at home by christopher jackson himself it will be too absurd to talk of expense and as long as jackson is employed everything will be right with sir thomas don t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself don t act yourself if you do not like it but don t expect to govern everybody else,Tom Bertram,['Edmund']
Q466,no as to acting myself that i absolutely protest against,Edmund,['Tom Bertram']
Q467,perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them your brother s taste and your sisters seem very different,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q468,i have no hope there fanny if they persist in the scheme they will find something i shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them and that is all i can do,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q469,i should think my aunt norris would be on your side,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q470,i dare say she would but she has no influence with either tom or my sisters that could be of any use and if i cannot convince them myself i shall let things take their course without attempting it through her family squabbling is the greatest evil of all and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q471,no want of hands in our theatre miss bertram no want of understrappers my sister desires her love and hopes to be admitted into the company and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante that you may not like to do yourselves,Henry Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q472,oh no that will never do let us have no ranting tragedies too many characters not a tolerable woman s part in the play anything but that my dear tom it would be impossible to fill it up one could not expect anybody to take such a part nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end that might do perhaps but for the low parts if i must give my opinion i have always thought it the most insipid play in the english language i do not wish to make objections i shall be happy to be of any use but i think we could not chuse worse,_unknowable,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q473,this will never do we are wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on no matter what so that something is chosen we must not be so nice a few characters too many must not frighten us we must double them we must descend a little if a part is insignificant the greater our credit in making anything of it from this moment i make no difficulties i take any part you chuse to give me so as it be comic let it but be comic i condition for nothing more,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q474,lovers vows and why should not lovers vows do for us as well as for the ravenshaws how came it never to be thought of before it strikes me as if it would do exactly what say you all here are two capital tragic parts for yates and crawford and here is the rhyming butler for me if nobody else wants it a trifling part but the sort of thing i should not dislike and as i said before i am determined to take anything and do my best and as for the rest they may be filled up by anybody it is only count cassel and anhalt,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q475,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford,Julia Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q476,it falls as naturally as necessarily to her as agatha does to one or other of my sisters it can be no sacrifice on their side for it is highly comic,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q477,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q478,oh yes maria must be agatha maria will be the best agatha though julia fancies she prefers tragedy i would not trust her in it there is nothing of tragedy about her she has not the look of it her features are not tragic features and she walks too quick and speaks too quick and would not keep her countenance she had better do the old countrywoman the cottager s wife you had indeed julia cottager s wife is a very pretty part i assure you the old lady relieves the high flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit you shall be cottager s wife,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q479,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better,Mr. Yates,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q480,why as to that my good friend till i and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork but i mean no disparagement to julia we cannot have two agathas and we must have one cottager s wife and i am sure i set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old butler if the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous let her take cottager s speeches instead of cottager s wife s and so change the parts all through he is solemn and pathetic enough i am sure it could make no difference in the play and as for cottager himself when he has got his wife s speeches i would undertake him with all my heart,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q481,with all your partiality for cottager s wife it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed on we must not allow her to accept the part she must not be left to her own complaisance her talents will be wanted in amelia amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even agatha i consider amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece it requires great powers great nicety to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance i have seen good actresses fail in the part simplicity indeed is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession it requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not it requires a gentlewoman a julia bertram you will undertake it i hope,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q482,no no julia must not be amelia it is not at all the part for her she would not like it she would not do well she is too tall and robust amelia should be a small light girlish skipping figure it is fit for miss crawford and miss crawford only she looks the part and i am persuaded will do it admirably,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q483,you must oblige us indeed you must when you have studied the character i am sure you will feel it suit you tragedy may be your choice but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you you will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions you will not refuse to visit me in prison i think i see you coming in with your basket,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q484,you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when i come in with a basket of provisions though one might have supposed but it is only as agatha that i was to be so overpowering,Julia Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q485,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q486,do not be afraid of my wanting the character i am not to be agatha and i am sure i will do nothing else and as to amelia it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me i quite detest her an odious little pert unnatural impudent girl i have always protested against comedy and this is comedy in its worst form,Julia Bertram,"['Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Tom Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram']"
Q487,i am sure i would give up the part to julia most willingly but that though i shall probably do it very ill i feel persuaded she would do it worse,Maria Bertram,['Henry Crawford']
Q488,we have got a play it is to be lovers vows and i am to be count cassel and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit by way of a shooting dress i do not know how i shall like it,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q489,lovers vows,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q490,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part,Mr. Yates,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q491,but what do you do for women,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q492,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q493,i should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up with us,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q494,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q495,i cannot before mr yates speak what i feel as to this play without reflecting on his friends at ecclesford but i must now my dear maria tell you that i think it exceedingly unfit for private representation and that i hope you will give it up i cannot but suppose you will when you have read it carefully over read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt and see how you can approve it it will not be necessary to send you to your father s judgment i am convinced,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q496,we see things very differently i am perfectly acquainted with the play i assure you and with a very few omissions and so forth which will be made of course i can see nothing objectionable in it and i am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q497,i am sorry for it but in this matter it is you who are to lead you must set the example if others have blundered it is your place to put them right and shew them what true delicacy is in all points of decorum your conduct must be law to the rest of the party,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q498,i am much obliged to you edmund you mean very well i am sure but i still think you see things too strongly and i really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind there would be the greatest indecorum i think,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q499,do you imagine that i could have such an idea in my head no let your conduct be the only harangue say that on examining the part you feel yourself unequal to it that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have say this with firmness and it will be quite enough all who can distinguish will understand your motive the play will be given up and your delicacy honoured as it ought,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q500,do not act anything improper my dear sir thomas would not like it fanny ring the bell i must have my dinner to be sure julia is dressed by this time,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q501,i am convinced madam that sir thomas would not like it,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q502,there my dear do you hear what edmund says,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q503,if i were to decline the part julia would certainly take it,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q504,what if she knew your reasons,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q505,oh she might think the difference between us the difference in our situations that she need not be so scrupulous as i might feel necessary i am sure she would argue so no you must excuse me i cannot retract my consent it is too far settled everybody would be so disappointed tom would be quite angry and if we are so very nice we shall never act anything,Maria Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q506,i was just going to say the very same thing if every play is to be objected to you will act nothing and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away and i am sure that would be a discredit to us all i do not know the play but as maria says if there is anything a little too warm and it is so with most of them it can be easily left out we must not be over precise edmund as mr rushworth is to act too there can be no harm i only wish tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began for there was the loss of half a day s work about those side doors the curtain will be a good job however the maids do their work very well and i think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings there is no occasion to put them so very close together i am of some use i hope in preventing waste and making the most of things there should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones i forgot to tell tom of something that happened to me this very day i had been looking about me in the poultry yard and was just coming out when who should i see but dick jackson making up to the servants hall door with two bits of deal board in his hand bringing them to father you may be sure mother had chanced to send him of a message to father and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board for he could not no how do without them i knew what all this meant for the servants dinner bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads and as i hate such encroaching people the jacksons are very encroaching i have always said so just the sort of people to get all they can i said to the boy directly a great lubberly fellow of ten years old you know who ought to be ashamed of himself i ll take the boards to your father dick so get you home again as fast as you can the boy looked very silly and turned away without offering a word for i believe i might speak pretty sharp and i dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while i hate such greediness so good as your father is to the family employing the man all the year round,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q507,well how do you go on,_unknowable,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q508,what have you settled,_unknowable,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q509,oh we can do nothing without you,_unknowable,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q510,i must really congratulate your ladyship on the play being chosen for though you have borne it with exemplary patience i am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties the actors may be glad but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision and i do sincerely give you joy madam as well as mrs norris and everybody else who is in the same predicament,Mary Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q511,my good friends you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses inside and out but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile who is to be anhalt what gentleman among you am i to have the pleasure of making love to,Mary Crawford,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q512,mr rushworth was to be count cassel but no one had yet undertaken anhalt,_unknowable,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram']"
Q513,i had my choice of the parts but i thought i should like the count best though i do not much relish the finery i am to have,Mr. Rushworth,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q514,you chose very wisely i am sure anhalt is a heavy part,Mary Crawford,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q515,the count has two and forty speeches which is no trifle,Mr. Rushworth,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q516,i am not at all surprised at this want of an anhalt amelia deserves no better such a forward young lady may well frighten the men,Mary Crawford,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q517,i should be but too happy in taking the part if it were possible but unluckily the butler and anhalt are in together i will not entirely give it up however i will try what can be done i will look it over again,Tom Bertram,"['Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates']"
Q518,your brother should take the part do not you think he would,Mr. Yates,['Tom Bertram']
Q519,i shall not ask him,Tom Bertram,['Mr. Yates']
Q520,they do not want me at all i only puzzle them and oblige them to make civil speeches mr edmund bertram as you do not act yourself you will be a disinterested adviser and therefore i apply to you what shall we do for an anhalt is it practicable for any of the others to double it what is your advice,Mary Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q521,my advice is that you change the play,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q522,i should have no objection for though i should not particularly dislike the part of amelia if well supported that is if everything went well i shall be sorry to be an inconvenience but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table it certainly will not be taken,Mary Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q523,if any part could tempt you to act i suppose it would be anhalt for he is a clergyman you know,Mary Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q524,that circumstance would by no means tempt me for i should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting it must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing a formal solemn lecturer and the man who chuses the profession itself is perhaps one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q525,fanny we want your services,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q526,oh we do not want to disturb you from your seat we do not want your present services we shall only want you in our play you must be cottager s wife,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q527,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Tom Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q528,indeed but you must for we cannot excuse you it need not frighten you it is a nothing of a part a mere nothing not above half a dozen speeches altogether and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say so you may be as creep mouse as you like but we must have you to look at,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q529,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn,Mr. Rushworth,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q530,it is not that i am afraid of learning by heart but i really cannot act,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Tom Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q531,yes yes you can act well enough for us learn your part and we will teach you all the rest you have only two scenes and as i shall be cottager i ll put you in and push you about and you will do it very well i ll answer for it,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q532,no indeed mr bertram you must excuse me you cannot have an idea it would be absolutely impossible for me if i were to undertake it i should only disappoint you,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Tom Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q533,phoo phoo do not be so shamefaced you ll do it very well every allowance will be made for you we do not expect perfection you must get a brown gown and a white apron and a mob cap and we must make you a few wrinkles and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes and you will be a very proper little old woman,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q534,you must excuse me indeed you must excuse me,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Tom Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q535,what a piece of work here is about nothing i am quite ashamed of you fanny to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort so kind as they are to you take the part with a good grace and let us hear no more of the matter i entreat,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q536,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q537,i am not going to urge her but i shall think her a very obstinate ungrateful girl if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her very ungrateful indeed considering who and what she is,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Edmund']"
Q538,i do not like my situation this place is too hot for me,Mary Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q539,never mind my dear miss price this is a cross evening everybody is cross and teasing but do not let us mind them,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q540,but there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it we have but to speak the word we may pick and chuse i could name at this moment at least six young men within six miles of us who are wild to be admitted into our company and there are one or two that would not disgrace us i should not be afraid to trust either of the olivers or charles maddox tom oliver is a very clever fellow and charles maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere so i will take my horse early to morrow morning and ride over to stoke and settle with one of them,Tom Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q541,as far as i am concerned i can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible have i ever seen either of the gentlemen yes mr charles maddox dined at my sister s one day did not he henry a quiet looking young man i remember him let him be applied to if you please for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger,Mary Crawford,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q542,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,Julia Bertram,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q543,i am not very sanguine as to our play and i can tell mr maddox that i shall shorten some of his speeches and a great many of my own before we rehearse together it will be very disagreeable and by no means what i expected,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q544,come in,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q545,can i speak with you fanny for a few minutes,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q546,yes certainly,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q547,i want to consult i want your opinion,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q548,my opinion,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q549,yes your advice and opinion i do not know what to do this acting scheme gets worse and worse you see they have chosen almost as bad a play as they could and now to complete the business are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us this is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first i know no harm of charles maddox but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable the more than intimacy the familiarity i cannot think of it with any patience and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must if possible be prevented do not you see it in the same light,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q550,yes but what can be done your brother is so determined,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q551,there is but one thing to be done fanny i must take anhalt myself i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q552,it is not at all what i like no man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency after being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect but i can think of no other alternative can you fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q553,no not immediately but,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q554,but what i see your judgment is not with me think it a little over perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief that may of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man s being received in this manner domesticated among us authorised to come at all hours and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints to think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create it is all very bad put yourself in miss crawford s place fanny consider what it would be to act amelia with a stranger she has a right to be felt for because she evidently feels for herself i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be it would be ungenerous it would be really wrong to expose her to it her feelings ought to be respected does it not strike you so fanny you hesitate,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q555,i am sorry for miss crawford but i am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle it will be such a triumph to the others,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q556,they will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously i act but however triumph there certainly will be and i must brave it but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business of limiting the exhibition of concentrating our folly i shall be well repaid as i am now i have no influence i can do nothing i have offended them and they will not hear me but when i have put them in good humour by this concession i am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for this will be a material gain my object is to confine it to mrs rushworth and the grants will not this be worth gaining,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q557,yes it will be a great point,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q558,but still it has not your approbation can you mention any other measure by which i have a chance of doing equal good,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q559,no i cannot think of anything else,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q560,give me your approbation then fanny i am not comfortable without it,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q561,oh cousin,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q562,if you are against me i ought to distrust myself and yet but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act no matter whom the look of a gentleman is to be enough i thought you would have entered more into miss crawford s feelings,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q563,no doubt she will be very glad it must be a great relief to her,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q564,she never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night it gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q565,she was very kind indeed and i am glad to have her spared,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q566,i shall walk down immediately after breakfast and am sure of giving pleasure there and now dear fanny i will not interrupt you any longer you want to be reading but i could not be easy till i had spoken to you and come to a decision sleeping or waking my head has been full of this matter all night it is an evil but i am certainly making it less than it might be if tom is up i shall go to him directly and get it over and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity you in the meanwhile will be taking a trip into china i suppose how does lord macartney go on and here are crabbe s tales and the idler at hand to relieve you if you tire of your great book i admire your little establishment exceedingly and as soon as i am gone you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting and sit comfortably down to your table but do not stay here to be cold,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q567,perhaps fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now perhaps you may persuade her,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q568,no she is quite determined she certainly will not act,Edmund,"['Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q569,oh very well,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q570,i rather wonder julia is not in love with henry,Mrs. Grant,['Mary Crawford']
Q571,i dare say she is i imagine both sisters are,Mary Crawford,['Mrs. Grant']
Q572,both no no that must not be do not give him a hint of it think of mr rushworth,Mrs. Grant,['Mary Crawford']
Q573,you had better tell miss bertram to think of mr rushworth it may do her some good i often think of mr rushworth s property and independence and wish them in other hands but i never think of him a man might represent the county with such an estate a man might escape a profession and represent the county,Mary Crawford,['Mrs. Grant']

Q577,will not that do mrs grant everything seems to depend upon sir thomas s return,Mary Crawford,['Mrs. Grant']
Q578,you will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family i assure you i do not think we do so well without him he has a fine dignified manner which suits the head of such a house and keeps everybody in their place lady bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home and nobody else can keep mrs norris in order but mary do not fancy that maria bertram cares for henry i am sure julia does not or she would not have flirted as she did last night with mr yates and though he and maria are very good friends i think she likes sotherton too well to be inconstant,Mrs. Grant,['Mary Crawford']
Q579,i would not give much for mr rushworth s chance if henry stept in before the articles were signed,Mary Crawford,['Mrs. Grant']
Q580,if you have such a suspicion something must be done and as soon as the play is all over we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind and if he means nothing we will send him off though he is henry for a time,Mrs. Grant,['Mary Crawford']
Q581,do you think there is anything so very fine in all this for the life and soul of me i cannot admire him and between ourselves to see such an undersized little mean looking man set up for a fine actor is very ridiculous in my opinion,Mr. Rushworth,['Fanny Price']
Q582,come fanny these are fine times for you but you must not be always walking from one room to the other and doing the lookings on at your ease in this way i want you here i have been slaving myself till i can hardly stand to contrive mr rushworth s cloak without sending for any more satin and now i think you may give me your help in putting it together there are but three seams you may do them in a trice it would be lucky for me if i had nothing but the executive part to do you are best off i can tell you but if nobody did more than you we should not get on very fast,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q583,one cannot wonder sister that fanny should be delighted it is all new to her you know you and i used to be very fond of a play ourselves and so am i still and as soon as i am a little more at leisure i mean to look in at their rehearsals too what is the play about fanny you have never told me,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q584,oh sister pray do not ask her now for fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time it is about lovers vows,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q585,i believe there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q586,you had better stay till the curtain is hung the curtain will be hung in a day or two there is very little sense in a play without a curtain and i am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q587,am i right yes this is the east room my dear miss price i beg your pardon but i have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q588,thank you i am quite warm very warm allow me to stay here a little while and do have the goodness to hear me my third act i have brought my book and if you would but rehearse it with me i should be so obliged i came here to day intending to rehearse it with edmund by ourselves against the evening but he is not in the way and if he were i do not think i could go through it with him till i have hardened myself a little for really there is a speech or two you will be so good won t you,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q589,have you ever happened to look at the part i mean here it is i did not think much of it at first but upon my word there look at that speech and that and that how am i ever to look him in the face and say such things could you do it but then he is your cousin which makes all the difference you must rehearse it with me that i may fancy you him and get on by degrees you have a look of his sometimes,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q590,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q591,none of it i suppose you are to have the book of course now for it we must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage there very good school room chairs not made for a theatre i dare say much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson what would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose could sir thomas look in upon us just now he would bless himself for we are rehearsing all over the house yates is storming away in the dining room i heard him as i came upstairs and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers agatha and frederick if they are not perfect i shall be surprised by the bye i looked in upon them five minutes ago and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying not to embrace and mr rushworth was with me i thought he began to look a little queer so i turned it off as well as i could by whispering to him we shall have an excellent agatha there is something so maternal in her manner so completely maternal in her voice and countenance was not that well done of me he brightened up directly now for my soliloquy,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q592,dr grant is ill he has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today he fancied it tough sent away his plate and has been suffering ever since,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth']"
Q593,if miss price would be so good as to read the part,_unknowable,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mr. Rushworth']"
Q594,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mr. Rushworth']"
Q595,you have only to read the part,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mr. Rushworth']"
Q596,and i do believe she can say every word of it for she could put mrs grant right the other day in twenty places fanny i am sure you know the part,Maria Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mr. Rushworth']"

Q600,but where is fanny why do not i see my little fanny,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q601,sure my dear sir thomas a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea do have a basin of soup,Mrs. Norris,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q602,still the same anxiety for everybody s comfort my dear mrs norris but indeed i would rather have nothing but tea,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q603,well then lady bertram suppose you speak for tea directly suppose you hurry baddeley a little he seems behindhand to night,Mrs. Norris,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q604,how do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately sir thomas they have been acting we have been all alive with acting,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q605,indeed and what have you been acting,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q606,oh they ll tell you all about it,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q607,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q608,something must be done,Edmund,"['Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q609,it is time to think of our visitors where did you leave miss crawford fanny,Maria Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q610,then poor yates is all alone i will go and fetch him he will be no bad assistant when it all comes out,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q611,i come from your theatre i found myself in it rather unexpectedly its vicinity to my own room but in every respect indeed it took me by surprise as i had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character it appears a neat job however as far as i could judge by candlelight and does my friend christopher jackson credit,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q612,this was in fact the origin of our acting my friend yates brought the infection from ecclesford and it spread as those things always spread you know sir the faster probably from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly it was like treading old ground again,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q613,oh not to him look so to all the others but not to him,Fanny Price,[]
Q614,to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not unsuccessfully upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the crawfords being gone home that nothing more can be done to night but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening i should not be afraid of the result we bespeak your indulgence you understand as young performers we bespeak your indulgence,Mr. Yates,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q615,my indulgence shall be given sir but without any other rehearsal,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q616,i come home to be happy and indulgent,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q617,mr and miss crawford were mentioned in my last letters from mansfield do you find them agreeable acquaintance,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q618,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q619,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man,Mr. Rushworth,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q620,if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing,Mr. Rushworth,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q621,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mr. Yates', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q622,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish,Edmund,['Sir Thomas']
Q623,if i had not been active and made a point of being introduced to his mother and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit i am as certain as i sit here that nothing would have come of it for mr rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle but i left no stone unturned i was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister and at last i did persuade her you know the distance to sotherton it was in the middle of winter and the roads almost impassable but i did persuade her,Mrs. Norris,['Sir Thomas']
Q624,i know how great how justly great your influence is with lady bertram and her children and am the more concerned that it should not have been,Sir Thomas,['Mrs. Norris']
Q625,my dear sir thomas if you had seen the state of the roads that day i thought we should never have got through them though we had the four horses of course and poor old coachman would attend us out of his great love and kindness though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which i had been doctoring him for ever since michaelmas i cured him at last but he was very bad all the winter and this was such a day i could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture he was putting on his wig so i said coachman you had much better not go your lady and i shall be very safe you know how steady stephen is and charles has been upon the leaders so often now that i am sure there is no fear but however i soon found it would not do he was bent upon going and as i hate to be worrying and officious i said no more but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt and when we got into the rough lanes about stoke where what with frost and snow upon beds of stones it was worse than anything you can imagine i was quite in an agony about him and then the poor horses too to see them straining away you know how i always feel for the horses and when we got to the bottom of sandcroft hill what do you think i did you will laugh at me but i got out and walked up i did indeed it might not be saving them much but it was something and i could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals i caught a dreadful cold but that i did not regard my object was accomplished in the visit,Mrs. Norris,['Sir Thomas']
Q626,i hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it there is nothing very striking in mr rushworth s manners but i was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting he seemed to feel exactly as one could wish,Sir Thomas,['Mrs. Norris']
Q627,yes indeed and the more you know of him the better you will like him he is not a shining character but he has a thousand good qualities and is so disposed to look up to you that i am quite laughed at about it for everybody considers it as my doing upon my word mrs norris said mrs grant the other day if mr rushworth were a son of your own he could not hold sir thomas in greater respect,Mrs. Norris,['Sir Thomas']
Q628,from bath norfolk london york wherever i may be i will attend you from any place in england at an hour s notice,Henry Crawford,['Maria Bertram']
Q629,i am sorry you are going but as to our play that is all over entirely at an end the painter was sent off yesterday and very little will remain of the theatre to morrow i knew how that would be from the first it is early for bath you will find nobody there,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q630,it is about my uncle s usual time,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q631,when do you think of going,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q632,i may perhaps get as far as banbury to day,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q633,whose stables do you use at bath,Tom Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q634,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q635,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q636,i believe you are right fanny i believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were than assuming a new character the novelty was in their being lively yet how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give i have been feeling as if we had never lived so before,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q637,i suppose i am graver than other people the evenings do not appear long to me i love to hear my uncle talk of the west indies i could listen to him for an hour together it entertains me more than many other things have done but then i am unlike other people i dare say,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q638,why should you dare say that,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q639,do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet but when did you or anybody ever get a compliment from me fanny go to my father if you want to be complimented he will satisfy you ask your uncle what he thinks and you will hear compliments enough and though they may be chiefly on your person you must put up with it and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q640,your uncle thinks you very pretty dear fanny and that is the long and the short of the matter anybody but myself would have made something more of it and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before but the truth is that your uncle never did admire you till now and now he does your complexion is so improved and you have gained so much countenance and your figure nay fanny do not turn away about it it is but an uncle if you cannot bear an uncle s admiration what is to become of you you must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at you must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q641,oh don t talk so don t talk so,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q642,your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect and i only wish you would talk to him more you are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q643,but i do talk to him more than i used i am sure i do did not you hear me ask him about the slave trade last night,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q644,i did and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others it would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q645,and i longed to do it but there was such a dead silence and while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word or seeming at all interested in the subject i did not like i thought it would appear as if i wanted to set myself off at their expense by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q646,miss crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect we were talking of you at the parsonage and those were her words she has great discernment i know nobody who distinguishes characters better for so young a woman it is remarkable she certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long and with regard to some others i can perceive from occasional lively hints the unguarded expressions of the moment that she could define many as accurately did not delicacy forbid it i wonder what she thinks of my father she must admire him as a fine looking man with most gentlemanlike dignified consistent manners but perhaps having seen him so seldom his reserve may be a little repulsive could they be much together i feel sure of their liking each other he would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers i wish they met more frequently i hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q647,she must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you to have any such apprehension and sir thomas s wishing just at first to be only with his family is so very natural that she can argue nothing from that after a little while i dare say we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way allowing for the difference of the time of year,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q648,this is the first october that she has passed in the country since her infancy i do not call tunbridge or cheltenham the country and november is a still more serious month and i can see that mrs grant is very anxious for her not finding mansfield dull as winter comes on,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q649,to morrow i think my uncle dines at sotherton and you and mr bertram too we shall be quite a small party at home i hope my uncle may continue to like mr rushworth,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q650,that is impossible fanny he must like him less after to morrow s visit for we shall be five hours in his company i should dread the stupidity of the day if there were not a much greater evil to follow the impression it must leave on sir thomas he cannot much longer deceive himself i am sorry for them all and would give something that rushworth and maria had never met,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q651,shall i play to you now,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q652,what will you have,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q653,another quarter of an hour and we shall see how it will be do not run away the first moment of its holding up those clouds look alarming,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q654,but they are passed over i have been watching them this weather is all from the south,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q655,south or north i know a black cloud when i see it and you must not set forward while it is so threatening and besides i want to play something more to you a very pretty piece and your cousin edmund s prime favourite you must stay and hear your cousin s favourite,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q656,this is pretty very pretty every time i come into this shrubbery i am more struck with its growth and beauty three years ago this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field never thought of as anything or capable of becoming anything and now it is converted into a walk and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament and perhaps in another three years we may be forgetting almost forgetting what it was before how wonderful how very wonderful the operations of time and the changes of the human mind,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q657,if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences the memory is sometimes so retentive so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered and so weak and at others again so tyrannic so beyond control we are to be sure a miracle every way but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q658,it may seem impertinent in me to praise but i must admire the taste mrs grant has shewn in all this there is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk not too much attempted,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q659,yes it does very well for a place of this sort one does not think of extent here and between ourselves till i came to mansfield i had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery or anything of the kind,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q660,i am so glad to see the evergreens thrive my uncle s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general the evergreen how beautiful how welcome how wonderful the evergreen when one thinks of it how astonishing a variety of nature in some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence you will think me rhapsodising but when i am out of doors especially when i am sitting out of doors i am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain one cannot fix one s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q661,to say the truth i am something like the famous doge at the court of lewis xiv and may declare that i see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it if anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home that i should be spending month after month here as i have done i certainly should not have believed them i have now been here nearly five months and moreover the quietest five months i ever passed,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q662,too quiet for you i believe,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q663,i should have thought so theoretically myself but take it all and all i never spent so happy a summer but then there is no saying what it may lead to,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q664,i am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than i had ever expected to be i can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country under certain circumstances very pleasant an elegant moderate sized house in the centre of family connexions continual engagements among them commanding the first society in the neighbourhood looked up to perhaps as leading it even more than those of larger fortune and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a t te t te with the person one feels most agreeable in the world there is nothing frightful in such a picture is there miss price one need not envy the new mrs rushworth with such a home as that,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q665,envy mrs rushworth come come it would be very un handsome in us to be severe on mrs rushworth for i look forward to our owing her a great many gay brilliant happy hours i expect we shall be all very much at sotherton another year such a match as miss bertram has made is a public blessing for the first pleasures of mr rushworth s wife must be to fill her house and give the best balls in the country,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q666,ah here he is my sister and mr bertram i am so glad your eldest cousin is gone that he may be mr bertram again there is something in the sound of mr edmund bertram so formal so pitiful so younger brother like that i detest it,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q667,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q668,i grant you the name is good in itself and lord edmund or sir edmund sound delightfully but sink it under the chill the annihilation of a mr and mr edmund is no more than mr john or mr thomas well shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year by being up before they can begin,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q669,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q670,perhaps i might have scolded if either of you had been sitting down alone but while you do wrong together i can overlook a great deal,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q671,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking,Mrs. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q672,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q673,upon my word you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends i ever met with there is no giving you a moment s uneasiness you do not know how much we have been suffering nor what chills we have felt but i have long thought mr bertram one of the worst subjects to work on in any little manoeuvre against common sense that a woman could be plagued with i had very little hope of him from the first but you mrs grant my sister my own sister i think i had a right to alarm you a little,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q674,do not flatter yourself my dearest mary you have not the smallest chance of moving me i have my alarms but they are quite in a different quarter and if i could have altered the weather you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time for here are some of my plants which robert will leave out because the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking everybody at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because i know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the fatigues of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like grievances and make me think the weather most unseasonably close,Mrs. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q675,the sweets of housekeeping in a country village commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q676,my dear child commend dr grant to the deanery of westminster or st paul s and i should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be but we have no such people in mansfield what would you have me do,Mrs. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q677,oh you can do nothing but what you do already be plagued very often and never lose your temper,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q678,thank you but there is no escaping these little vexations mary live where we may and when you are settled in town and i come to see you i dare say i shall find you with yours in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer perhaps on their very account their remoteness and unpunctuality or their exorbitant charges and frauds will be drawing forth bitter lamentations,Mrs. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q679,i mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of it certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q680,you intend to be very rich,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q681,to be sure do not you do not we all,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q682,i cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command miss crawford may chuse her degree of wealth she has only to fix on her number of thousands a year and there can be no doubt of their coming my intentions are only not to be poor,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q683,by moderation and economy and bringing down your wants to your income and all that i understand you and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life with such limited means and indifferent connexions what can you want but a decent maintenance you have not much time before you and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence be honest and poor by all means but i shall not envy you i do not much think i shall even respect you i have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q684,your degree of respect for honesty rich or poor is precisely what i have no manner of concern with i do not mean to be poor poverty is exactly what i have determined against honesty in the something between in the middle state of worldly circumstances is all that i am anxious for your not looking down on,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q685,but i do look down upon it if it might have been higher i must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q686,but how may it rise how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q687,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q688,that is not much to the purpose now and as to my being in parliament i believe i must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on no miss crawford there are distinctions which i should be miserable if i thought myself without any chance absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining but they are of a different character,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q689,and you know what your dinner will be the turkey and i assure you a very fine one for my dear cook insists upon the turkey s being dressed to morrow,Mrs. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Dr. Grant']"
Q690,very well very well all the better i am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house but miss price and mr edmund bertram i dare say would take their chance we none of us want to hear the bill of fare a friendly meeting and not a fine dinner is all we have in view a turkey or a goose or a leg of mutton or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us,Dr. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q691,but why should mrs grant ask fanny how came she to think of asking fanny fanny never dines there you know in this sort of way i cannot spare her and i am sure she does not want to go fanny you do not want to go do you,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price']"
Q692,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q693,i cannot imagine why mrs grant should think of asking her she never did before she used to ask your sisters now and then but she never asked fanny,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price']"
Q694,if you cannot do without me ma am,Fanny Price,"['Edmund', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q695,but my mother will have my father with her all the evening,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q696,to be sure so i shall,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price']"
Q697,suppose you take my father s opinion ma am,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q698,that s well thought of so i will edmund i will ask sir thomas as soon as he comes in whether i can do without her,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price']"
Q699,as you please ma am on that head but i meant my father s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation s being accepted or not and i think he will consider it a right thing by mrs grant as well as by fanny that being the first invitation it should be accepted,Edmund,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q700,i do not know we will ask him but he will be very much surprised that mrs grant should ask fanny at all,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price']"
Q701,sir thomas stop a moment i have something to say to you,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q702,i have something to tell you that will surprise you mrs grant has asked fanny to dinner,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q703,well,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q704,edmund wants her to go but how can i spare her,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q705,she will be late but what is your difficulty,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q706,so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q707,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister,Edmund,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q708,nothing can be more natural nor were there no sister in the case could anything in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q709,but can i do without her sir thomas,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q710,indeed i think you may,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q711,she always makes tea you know when my sister is not here,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q712,your sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend the day with us and i shall certainly be at home,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q713,very well then fanny may go edmund,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q714,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q715,thank you i am so glad,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q716,and yet why should i be glad for am i not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me,Fanny Price,[]
Q717,upon my word fanny you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence you ought to be very much obliged to mrs grant for thinking of you and to your aunt for letting you go and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary for i hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way or ever dining out at all and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to you the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me mrs grant thinks it a civility due to us to take a little notice of you or else it would never have come into her head and you may be very certain that if your cousin julia had been at home you would not have been asked at all,Mrs. Norris,['Fanny Price']
Q718,oh depend upon it your aunt can do very well without you or you would not be allowed to go i shall be here so you may be quite easy about your aunt and i hope you will have a very agreeable day and find it all mighty delightful but i must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table and i cannot but be surprised that such an elegant lady as mrs grant should not contrive better and round their enormous great wide table too which fills up the room so dreadfully had the doctor been contented to take my dining table when i came away as anybody in their senses would have done instead of having that absurd new one of his own which is wider literally wider than the dinner table here how infinitely better it would have been and how much more he would have been respected for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere remember that fanny five only five to be sitting round that table however you will have dinner enough on it for ten i dare say,Mrs. Norris,['Fanny Price']
Q719,the nonsense and folly of people s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves makes me think it right to give you a hint fanny now that you are going into company without any of us and i do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins as if you were dear mrs rushworth or julia that will never do believe me remember wherever you are you must be the lowest and last and though miss crawford is in a manner at home at the parsonage you are not to be taking place of her and as to coming away at night you are to stay just as long as edmund chuses leave him to settle that,Mrs. Norris,['Fanny Price']
Q720,yes ma am i should not think of anything else,Fanny Price,['Mrs. Norris']
Q721,and if it should rain which i think exceedingly likely for i never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life you must manage as well as you can and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you i certainly do not go home to night and therefore the carriage will not be out on my account so you must make up your mind to what may happen and take your things accordingly,Mrs. Norris,['Fanny Price']
Q722,fanny at what time would you have the carriage come round,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q723,my dear sir thomas fanny can walk,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q724,walk my niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year will twenty minutes after four suit you,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q725,yes sir,Fanny Price,"['Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q726,quite unnecessary a great deal too kind but edmund goes true it is upon edmund s account i observed he was hoarse on thursday night,Mrs. Norris,[]
Q727,now i must look at you fanny and tell you how i like you and as well as i can judge by this light you look very nicely indeed what have you got on,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q728,the new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin s marriage i hope it is not too fine but i thought i ought to wear it as soon as i could and that i might not have such another opportunity all the winter i hope you do not think me too fine,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q729,a woman can never be too fine while she is all in white no i see no finery about you nothing but what is perfectly proper your gown seems very pretty i like these glossy spots has not miss crawford a gown something the same,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q730,heyday here s company here s a carriage who have they got to meet us tis crawford s crawford s barouche i protest there are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters he is here of course this is quite a surprise fanny i shall be very glad to see him,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q731,so rushworth and his fair bride are at brighton i understand happy man,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q732,yes they have been there about a fortnight miss price have they not and julia is with them,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q733,and mr yates i presume is not far off,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q734,mr yates oh we hear nothing of mr yates i do not imagine he figures much in the letters to mansfield park do you miss price i think my friend julia knows better than to entertain her father with mr yates,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q735,poor rushworth and his two and forty speeches nobody can ever forget them poor fellow i see him now his toil and his despair well i am much mistaken if his lovely maria will ever want him to make two and forty speeches to her she is too good for him much too good,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q736,you were mr rushworth s best friend your kindness and patience can never be forgotten your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own he might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness but i may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q737,it is as a dream a pleasant dream i shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure there was such an interest such an animation such a spirit diffused everybody felt it we were all alive there was employment hope solicitude bustle for every hour of the day always some little objection some little doubt some little anxiety to be got over i never was happier,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q738,never happier never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly oh what a corrupted mind,Fanny Price,[]
Q739,we were unlucky miss price we certainly were very unlucky another week only one other week would have been enough for us i think if we had had the disposal of events if mansfield park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two about the equinox there would have been a difference not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather but only by a steady contrary wind or a calm i think miss price we would have indulged ourselves with a week s calm in the atlantic at that season,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q740,as far as i am concerned sir i would not have delayed his return for a day my uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q741,i believe you are right it was more pleasant than prudent we were getting too noisy,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q742,those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q743,the most interesting in the world how to make money how to turn a good income into a better dr grant is giving bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon i find he takes orders in a few weeks they were at it in the dining parlour i am glad to hear bertram will be so well off he will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with and earned without much trouble i apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother and as of course he will still live at home it will be all for his menus plaisirs and a sermon at christmas and easter i suppose will be the sum total of sacrifice,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q744,nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves you would look rather blank henry if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year,Mary Crawford,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q745,perhaps i might but all that you know is entirely comparative birthright and habit must settle the business bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet s family by the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year and nothing to do for it,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford']"
Q746,bertram i shall make a point of coming to mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as i shall do not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil when will it be you must preach at mansfield you know that sir thomas and lady bertram may hear you,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q747,i shall keep clear of you crawford as long as i can for you would be more likely to disconcert me and i should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant']"
Q748,will he not feel this no he can feel nothing as he ought,Fanny Price,[]
Q749,and how do you think i mean to amuse myself mary on the days that i do not hunt i am grown too old to go out more than three times a week but i have a plan for the intermediate days and what do you think it is,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q750,to walk and ride with me to be sure,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q751,not exactly though i shall be happy to do both but that would be exercise only to my body and i must take care of my mind besides that would be all recreation and indulgence without the wholesome alloy of labour and i do not like to eat the bread of idleness no my plan is to make fanny price in love with me,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q752,fanny price nonsense no no you ought to be satisfied with her two cousins,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q753,but i cannot be satisfied without fanny price without making a small hole in fanny price s heart you do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice when we talked of her last night you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks you see her every day and therefore do not notice it but i assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn she was then merely a quiet modest not plain looking girl but she is now absolutely pretty i used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance but in that soft skin of hers so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday there is decided beauty and from what i observed of her eyes and mouth i do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express and then her air her manner her tout ensemble is so indescribably improved she must be grown two inches at least since october,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q754,phoo phoo this is only because there were no tall women to compare her with and because she has got a new gown and you never saw her so well dressed before she is just what she was in october believe me the truth is that she was the only girl in company for you to notice and you must have a somebody i have always thought her pretty not strikingly pretty but pretty enough as people say a sort of beauty that grows on one her eyes should be darker but she has a sweet smile but as for this wonderful degree of improvement i am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress and your having nobody else to look at and therefore if you do set about a flirtation with her you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q755,i do not quite know what to make of miss fanny i do not understand her i could not tell what she would be at yesterday what is her character is she solemn is she queer is she prudish why did she draw back and look so grave at me i could hardly get her to speak i never was so long in company with a girl in my life trying to entertain her and succeed so ill never met with a girl who looked so grave on me i must try to get the better of this her looks say i will not like you i am determined not to like you and i say she shall,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q756,foolish fellow and so this is her attraction after all this it is her not caring about you which gives her such a soft skin and makes her so much taller and produces all these charms and graces i do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy a little love perhaps may animate and do her good but i will not have you plunge her deep for she is as good a little creature as ever lived and has a great deal of feeling,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q757,it can be but for a fortnight and if a fortnight can kill her she must have a constitution which nothing could save no i will not do her any harm dear little soul i only want her to look kindly on me to give me smiles as well as blushes to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are and be all animation when i take it and talk to her to think as i think be interested in all my possessions and pleasures try to keep me longer at mansfield and feel when i go away that she shall be never happy again i want nothing more,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q758,moderation itself i can have no scruples now well you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself for we are a great deal together,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q759,do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the commissioner s at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything,Henry Crawford,"['William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q760,dear me how disagreeable i wonder anybody can ever go to sea,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q761,what shall i do sir thomas whist and speculation which will amuse me most,Lady Bertram,['Sir Thomas']
Q762,very well then speculation if you please mrs grant i know nothing about it but fanny must teach me,Lady Bertram,['Sir Thomas']
Q763,i hope your ladyship is pleased with the game,Mrs. Grant,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q764,oh dear yes very entertaining indeed a very odd game i do not know what it is all about i am never to see my cards and mr crawford does all the rest,Lady Bertram,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q765,bertram i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home i told you i lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew trees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luck for i never do wrong without gaining by it i found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills a small stream before me to be forded a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentleman or half a gentleman s house to be seen excepting one to be presumed the parsonage within a stone s throw of the said knoll and church i found myself in short in thornton lacey,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q766,it sounds like it but which way did you turn after passing sewell s farm,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q767,i answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions though were i to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour you would never be able to prove that it was not thornton lacey for such it certainly was,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q768,you inquired then,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q769,no i never inquire but i told a man mending a hedge that it was thornton lacey and he agreed to it,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q770,you have a good memory i had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q771,well and how did you like what you saw,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q772,very much indeed you are a lucky fellow there will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q773,no no not so bad as that the farmyard must be moved i grant you but i am not aware of anything else the house is by no means bad and when the yard is removed there may be a very tolerable approach to it,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q774,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q775,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q776,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q777,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q778,have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q779,no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q780,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q781,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told,Mary Crawford,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q782,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q783,i should be sorry to have my powers of planning judged of by the day at sotherton i see things very differently now do not think of me as i appeared then,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q784,sotherton yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs rushworth will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr rushworth is a most amiable man they are at brighton now you know in one of the best houses there as mr rushworth s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to portsmouth if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins,Mrs. Norris,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q785,i should be very happy aunt but brighton is almost by beachey head and if i could get so far i could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that poor scrubby midshipman as i am,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q786,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q787,i would rather find him private secretary to the first lord than anything else,William Price,[]
Q788,i want to be your neighbour sir thomas as you have perhaps heard me telling miss price may i hope for your acquiescence and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q789,it is the only way sir in which i could not wish you established as a permanent neighbour but i hope and believe that edmund will occupy his own house at thornton lacey edmund am i saying too much,Sir Thomas,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q790,certainly sir i have no idea but of residence but crawford though i refuse you as a tenant come to me as a friend consider the house as half your own every winter and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q791,we shall be the losers his going though only eight miles will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle but i should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less it is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject mr crawford but a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent edmund might in the common phrase do the duty of thornton that is he might read prayers and preach without giving up mansfield park he might ride over every sunday to a house nominally inhabited and go through divine service he might be the clergyman of thornton lacey every seventh day for three or four hours if that would content him but it will not he knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey and that if he does not live among his parishioners and prove himself by constant attention their well wisher and friend he does very little either for their good or his own,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q792,i repeat again that thornton lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which i should not be happy to wait on mr crawford as occupier,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']"
Q793,sir thomas undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest we must hope his son may prove that he knows it too,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q794,this is the assembly night if i were at portsmouth i should be at it perhaps,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q795,but you do not wish yourself at portsmouth william,Fanny Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q796,no fanny that i do not i shall have enough of portsmouth and of dancing too when i cannot have you and i do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly for i might not get a partner the portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission one might as well be nothing as a midshipman one is nothing indeed you remember the gregorys they are grown up amazing fine girls but they will hardly speak to me because lucy is courted by a lieutenant,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q797,oh shame shame but never mind it william it is not worth minding it is no reflection on you it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced more or less in their time you must think of that you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor s share like bad weather and hard living only with this advantage that there will be an end to it that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure when you are a lieutenant only think william when you are a lieutenant how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind,Fanny Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q798,i begin to think i shall never be a lieutenant fanny everybody gets made but me,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q799,oh my dear william do not talk so do not be so desponding my uncle says nothing but i am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made he knows as well as you do of what consequence it is,Fanny Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q800,are you fond of dancing fanny,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q801,yes very only i am soon tired,Fanny Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q802,i should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance have you never any balls at northampton i should like to see you dance and i d dance with you if you would for nobody would know who i was here and i should like to be your partner once more we used to jump about together many a time did not we when the hand organ was in the street i am a pretty good dancer in my way but i dare say you are a better,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q803,is not fanny a very good dancer sir,William Price,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q804,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q805,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of,Henry Crawford,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q806,come fanny fanny what are you about we are going do not you see your aunt is going quick quick i cannot bear to keep good old wilcox waiting you should always remember the coachman and horses my dear sir thomas we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you and edmund and william,Mrs. Norris,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mary Crawford', 'Dr. Grant', 'Mrs. Grant', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q807,i do not like william that you should leave northamptonshire without this indulgence it would give me pleasure to see you both dance you spoke of the balls at northampton your cousins have occasionally attended them but they would not altogether suit us now the fatigue would be too much for your aunt i believe we must not think of a northampton ball a dance at home would be more eligible and if,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q808,ah my dear sir thomas i knew what was coming i knew what you were going to say if dear julia were at home or dearest mrs rushworth at sotherton to afford a reason an occasion for such a thing you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at mansfield i know you would if they were at home to grace the ball a ball you would have this very christmas thank your uncle william thank your uncle,Mrs. Norris,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q809,my daughters have their pleasures at brighton and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at mansfield will be for their cousins could we be all assembled our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement,Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q810,but what shall you have by way of necklace shall not you wear your brother s cross,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q811,you see what a collection i have more by half than i ever use or think of i do not offer them as new i offer nothing but an old necklace you must forgive the liberty and oblige me,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q812,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q813,you must think of somebody else too when you wear that necklace you must think of henry for it was his choice in the first place he gave it to me and with the necklace i make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver it is to be a family remembrancer the sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q814,my dear child what are you afraid of do you think henry will claim the necklace as mine and fancy you did not come honestly by it or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago before he knew there was such a throat in the world or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q815,well then to convince me that you suspect no trick and are as unsuspicious of compliment as i have always found you take the necklace and say no more about it its being a gift of my brother s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it he is always giving me something or other i have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half and as for this necklace i do not suppose i have worn it six times it is very pretty but i never think of it and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q816,fanny i beg your pardon for being here i came to look for you and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand you will find the beginning of a note to yourself but i can now speak my business which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle a chain for william s cross you ought to have had it a week ago but there has been a delay from my brother s not being in town by several days so soon as i expected and i have only just now received it at northampton i hope you will like the chain itself fanny i endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste but at any rate i know you will be kind to my intentions and consider it as it really is a token of the love of one of your oldest friends,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q817,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q818,i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q819,if that is all you have to say fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q820,no no it is not i want to consult you,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q821,oh this is beautiful indeed this is the very thing precisely what i wished for this is the only ornament i have ever had a desire to possess it will exactly suit my cross they must and shall be worn together it comes too in such an acceptable moment oh cousin you do not know how acceptable it is,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q822,my dear fanny you feel these things a great deal too much i am most happy that you like the chain and that it should be here in time for to morrow but your thanks are far beyond the occasion believe me i have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours no i can safely say i have no pleasure so complete so unalloyed it is without a drawback,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q823,but what is it that you want to consult me about,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q824,return the necklace no my dear fanny upon no account it would be mortifying her severely there can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q825,if it had been given to me in the first instance i should not have thought of returning it but being her brother s present is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it when it is not wanted,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q826,she must not suppose it not wanted not acceptable at least and its having been originally her brother s gift makes no difference for as she was not prevented from offering nor you from taking it on that account it ought not to prevent you from keeping it no doubt it is handsomer than mine and fitter for a ballroom,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q827,no it is not handsomer not at all handsomer in its way and for my purpose not half so fit the chain will agree with william s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q828,for one night fanny for only one night if it be a sacrifice i am sure you will upon consideration make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort miss crawford s attentions to you have been not more than you were justly entitled to i am the last person to think that could be but they have been invariable and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude though i know it could never have the meaning is not in your nature i am sure wear the necklace as you are engaged to do to morrow evening and let the chain which was not ordered with any reference to the ball be kept for commoner occasions this is my advice i would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy i have been observing with the greatest pleasure and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences resulting principally from situation no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship i would not have the shadow of a coolness arise between the two dearest objects i have on earth,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q829,suppose i were to find him there again to day,Fanny Price,[]
Q830,fanny you look tired and fagged fanny you have been walking too far,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q831,no i have not been out at all,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q832,then you have had fatigues within doors which are worse you had better have gone out,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q833,i come from dr grant s you may guess my errand there fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q834,i wished to engage miss crawford for the two first dances,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q835,yes she is engaged to me but she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me she is not serious i think i hope i am sure she is not serious but i would rather not hear it she never has danced with a clergyman she says and she never will for my own sake i could wish there had been no ball just at i mean not this very week this very day to morrow i leave home,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q836,i am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you this ought to be a day of pleasure my uncle meant it so,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q837,oh yes yes and it will be a day of pleasure it will all end right i am only vexed for a moment in fact it is not that i consider the ball as ill timed what does it signify but fanny,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q838,you know what all this means you see how it is and could tell me perhaps better than i could tell you how and why i am vexed let me talk to you a little you are a kind kind listener i have been pained by her manner this morning and cannot get the better of it i know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own but the influence of her former companions makes her seem gives to her conversation to her professed opinions sometimes a tinge of wrong she does not think evil but she speaks it speaks it in playfulness and though i know it to be playfulness it grieves me to the soul,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q839,the effect of education,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q840,yes that uncle and aunt they have injured the finest mind for sometimes fanny i own to you it does appear more than manner it appears as if the mind itself was tainted,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q841,if you only want me as a listener cousin i will be as useful as i can but i am not qualified for an adviser do not ask advice of me i am not competent,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q842,you are right fanny to protest against such an office but you need not be afraid it is a subject on which i should never ask advice it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked and few i imagine do ask it but when they want to be influenced against their conscience i only want to talk to you,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q843,one thing more excuse the liberty but take care how you talk to me do not tell me anything now which hereafter you may be sorry for the time may come,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q844,dearest fanny you are all considerate thought but it is unnecessary here the time will never come no such time as you allude to will ever come i begin to think it most improbable the chances grow less and less and even if it should there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of for i can never be ashamed of my own scruples and if they are removed it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had you are the only being upon earth to whom i should say what i have said but you have always known my opinion of her you can bear me witness fanny that i have never been blinded how many a time have we talked over her little errors you need not fear me i have almost given up every serious idea of her but i must be a blockhead indeed if whatever befell me i could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q845,yes cousin i am convinced that you would be incapable of anything else though perhaps some might not i cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say do not check yourself tell me whatever you like,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q846,yes she looks very well i sent chapman to her,Lady Bertram,"['Mrs. Norris', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q847,look well oh yes she has good reason to look well with all her advantages brought up in this family as she has been with all the benefit of her cousins manners before her only think my dear sir thomas what extraordinary advantages you and i have been the means of giving her the very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear mrs rushworth married what would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand,Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q848,you must dance with me fanny you must keep two dances for me any two that you like except the first,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q849,did he did edmund that was like himself no other man would have thought of it i honour him beyond expression,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q850,it must be so my dear,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q851,yes she does look very well chapman helped her to dress i sent chapman to her,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q852,ah ma am how much we want dear mrs rushworth and julia to night,Mary Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q853,perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to morrow he says he has business there but will not tell me what the first time he ever denied me his confidence but this is what we all come to all are supplanted sooner or later now i must apply to you for information pray what is henry going for,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q854,well then i must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother and of talking of you by the way,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q855,i am worn out with civility i have been talking incessantly all night and with nothing to say but with you fanny there may be peace you will not want to be talked to let us have the luxury of silence,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q856,poor fanny how soon she is knocked up why the sport is but just begun i hope we shall keep it up these two hours how can you be tired so soon,William Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q857,so soon my good friend it is three o clock and your sister is not used to these sort of hours,Sir Thomas,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price']"
Q858,well then fanny you shall not get up to morrow before i go sleep as long as you can and never mind me,William Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q859,oh william,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q860,what did she think of being up before you set off,Sir Thomas,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price']"
Q861,oh yes sir i must get up and breakfast with him it will be the last time you know the last morning,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q862,you had better not he is to have breakfasted and be gone by half past nine mr crawford i think you call for him at half past nine,Sir Thomas,"['Henry Crawford', 'William Price', 'Fanny Price']"
Q863,yes half past nine and i shall be punctual for there will be no kind sister to get up for me,Henry Crawford,"['William Price', 'Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q864,i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to morrow,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q865,i cannot think what is the matter with me i feel quite stupid it must be sitting up so late last night fanny you must do something to keep me awake i cannot work fetch the cards i feel so very stupid,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q866,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you,Fanny Price,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q867,we miss our two young men,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q868,and there is no reason to suppose but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent as to edmund we must learn to do without him this will be the last winter of his belonging to us as he has done,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q869,yes but i wish he was not going away they are all going away i think i wish they would stay at home,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q870,sir thomas i have been thinking and i am very glad we took fanny as we did for now the others are away we feel the good of it,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q871,very true we shew fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face she is now a very valuable companion if we have been kind to her she is now quite as necessary to us,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q872,yes and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have her,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q873,she will never leave us i hope till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q874,and that is not very likely to be sir thomas who should invite her maria might be very glad to see her at sotherton now and then but she would not think of asking her to live there and i am sure she is better off here and besides i cannot do without her,Lady Bertram,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q875,and how do you like your cousin edmund s staying away so long being the only young person at home i consider you as the greatest sufferer you must miss him does his staying longer surprise you,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q876,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q877,perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of it is the general way all young men do,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q878,he did not the only time he went to see mr owen before,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q879,he finds the house more agreeable now he is a very a very pleasing young man himself and i cannot help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before i go to london as will now undoubtedly be the case i am looking for henry every day and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at mansfield i should like to have seen him once more i confess but you must give my compliments to him yes i think it must be compliments is not there a something wanted miss price in our language a something between compliments and and love to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together so many months acquaintance but compliments may be sufficient here was his letter a long one does he give you much account of what he is doing is it christmas gaieties that he is staying for,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q880,i only heard a part of the letter it was to my uncle but i believe it was very short indeed i am sure it was but a few lines all that i heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer and that he had agreed to do so a few days longer or some days longer i am not quite sure which,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q881,oh if he wrote to his father but i thought it might have been to lady bertram or you but if he wrote to his father no wonder he was concise who could write chat to sir thomas if he had written to you there would have been more particulars you would have heard of balls and parties he would have sent you a description of everything and everybody how many miss owens are there,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q882,three grown up,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q883,are they musical,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q884,i do not at all know i never heard,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q885,that is the first question you know which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another but it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies about any three sisters just grown up for one knows without being told exactly what they are all very accomplished and pleasing and one very pretty there is a beauty in every family it is a regular thing two play on the pianoforte and one on the harp and all sing or would sing if they were taught or sing all the better for not being taught or something like it,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q886,i know nothing of the miss owens,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q887,you know nothing and you care less as people say never did tone express indifference plainer indeed how can one care for those one has never seen well when your cousin comes back he will find mansfield very quiet all the noisy ones gone your brother and mine and myself i do not like the idea of leaving mrs grant now the time draws near she does not like my going,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q888,you cannot doubt your being missed by many you will be very much missed,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q889,oh yes missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away that is there is a great difference felt but i am not fishing don t compliment me if i am missed it will appear i may be discovered by those who want to see me i shall not be in any doubtful or distant or unapproachable region,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q890,the miss owens suppose you were to have one of the miss owens settled at thornton lacey how should you like it stranger things have happened i dare say they are trying for it and they are quite in the right for it would be a very pretty establishment for them i do not at all wonder or blame them it is everybody s duty to do as well for themselves as they can sir thomas bertram s son is somebody and now he is in their own line their father is a clergyman and their brother is a clergyman and they are all clergymen together he is their lawful property he fairly belongs to them you don t speak fanny miss price you don t speak but honestly now do not you rather expect it than otherwise,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q891,no i do not expect it at all,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q892,not at all i wonder at that but i dare say you know exactly i always imagine you are perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all or not at present,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q893,no i do not,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q894,he is best off as he is,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q895,my dear henry where can you have been all this time,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q896,sitting with them an hour and a half,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q897,yes mary i could not get away sooner fanny looked so lovely i am quite determined mary my mind is entirely made up will it astonish you no you must be aware that i am quite determined to marry fanny price,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q898,yes mary i am fairly caught you know with what idle designs i began but this is the end of them i have i flatter myself made no inconsiderable progress in her affections but my own are entirely fixed,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q899,lucky lucky girl what a match for her my dearest henry this must be my first feeling but my second which you shall have as sincerely is that i approve your choice from my soul and foresee your happiness as heartily as i wish and desire it you will have a sweet little wife all gratitude and devotion exactly what you deserve what an amazing match for her mrs norris often talks of her luck what will she say now the delight of all the family indeed and she has some true friends in it how they will rejoice but tell me all about it talk to me for ever when did you begin to think seriously about her,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q900,ah my dear henry and this is what took you to london this was your business you chose to consult the admiral before you made up your mind,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q901,when fanny is known to him he will doat on her she is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the admiral for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world she is the very impossibility he would describe if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas but till it is absolutely settled settled beyond all interference he shall know nothing of the matter no mary you are quite mistaken you have not discovered my business yet,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q902,well well i am satisfied i know now to whom it must relate and am in no hurry for the rest fanny price wonderful quite wonderful that mansfield should have done so much for that you should have found your fate in mansfield but you are quite right you could not have chosen better there is not a better girl in the world and you do not want for fortune and as to her connexions they are more than good the bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country she is niece to sir thomas bertram that will be enough for the world but go on go on tell me more what are your plans does she know her own happiness,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q903,no,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q904,what are you waiting for,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q905,for for very little more than opportunity mary she is not like her cousins but i think i shall not ask in vain,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q906,oh no you cannot were you even less pleasing supposing her not to love you already of which however i can have little doubt you would be safe the gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love that is if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition i can suppose it her but ask her to love you and she will never have the heart to refuse,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q907,i could so wholly and absolutely confide in her and that is what i want,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q908,the more i think of it the more am i convinced that you are doing quite right and though i should never have selected fanny price as the girl most likely to attach you i am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed you will both find your good in it,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q909,it was bad very bad in me against such a creature but i did not know her then and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head i will make her very happy mary happier than she has ever yet been herself or ever seen anybody else i will not take her from northamptonshire i shall let everingham and rent a place in this neighbourhood perhaps stanwix lodge i shall let a seven years lease of everingham i am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word i could name three people now who would give me my own terms and thank me,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q910,ha settle in northamptonshire that is pleasant then we shall be all together,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q911,you must give us more than half your time i cannot admit mrs grant to have an equal claim with fanny and myself for we shall both have a right in you fanny will be so truly your sister,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q912,you will divide your year between london and northamptonshire,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q913,yes,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q914,that s right and in london of course a house of your own no longer with the admiral my dearest henry the advantage to you of getting away from the admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life you are not sensible of the gain for your regard for him has blinded you but in my estimation your marrying early may be the saving of you to have seen you grow like the admiral in word or deed look or gesture would have broken my heart,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q915,well well we do not think quite alike here the admiral has his faults but he is a very good man and has been more than a father to me few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much you must not prejudice fanny against him i must have them love one another,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q916,henry i think so highly of fanny price that if i could suppose the next mrs crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill used aunt had to abhor the very name i would prevent the marriage if possible but i know you i know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women and that even when you ceased to love she would yet find in you the liberality and good breeding of a gentleman,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q917,had you seen her this morning mary attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt s stupidity working with her and for her her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman s service and all this with such unpretending gentleness so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command her hair arranged as neatly as it always is and one little curl falling forward as she wrote which she now and then shook back and in the midst of all this still speaking at intervals to me or listening and as if she liked to listen to what i said had you seen her so mary you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q918,my dearest henry how glad i am to see you so much in love it quite delights me but what will mrs rushworth and julia say,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q919,i care neither what they say nor what they feel they will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me that can attach a man of sense i wish the discovery may do them any good and they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be and i wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness they will be angry mrs rushworth will be very angry it will be a bitter pill to her that is like other bitter pills it will have two moments ill flavour and then be swallowed and forgotten for i am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women s though i was the object of them yes mary my fanny will feel a difference indeed a daily hourly difference in the behaviour of every being who approaches her and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that i am the doer of it that i am the person to give the consequence so justly her due now she is dependent helpless friendless neglected forgotten,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q920,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her,Mary Crawford,['Henry Crawford']
Q921,edmund true i believe he is generally speaking kind to her and so is sir thomas in his way but it is the way of a rich superior long worded arbitrary uncle what can sir thomas and edmund together do what do they do for her happiness comfort honour and dignity in the world to what i shall do,Henry Crawford,['Mary Crawford']
Q922,i must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone i have been wishing it more than you can have any idea knowing as i do what your feelings as a sister are i could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news i now bring he is made your brother is a lieutenant i have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother s promotion here are the letters which announce it this moment come to hand you will perhaps like to see them,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q923,i will not talk of my own happiness great as it is for i think only of yours compared with you who has a right to be happy i have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world i have not lost a moment however the post was late this morning but there has not been since a moment s delay how impatient how anxious how wild i have been on the subject i will not attempt to describe how severely mortified how cruelly disappointed in not having it finished while i was in london i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from mansfield but though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth i could desire and exerted himself immediately there were difficulties from the absence of one friend and the engagements of another which at last i could no longer bear to stay the end of and knowing in what good hands i left the cause i came away on monday trusting that many posts would not pass before i should be followed by such very letters as these my uncle who is the very best man in the world has exerted himself as i knew he would after seeing your brother he was delighted with him i would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted or to repeat half that the admiral said in his praise i deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend as this day does prove it now i may say that even i could not require william price to excite a greater interest or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q924,has this been all your doing then good heaven how very very kind have you really was it by your desire i beg your pardon but i am bewildered did admiral crawford apply how was it i am stupefied,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q925,how kind how very kind oh mr crawford we are infinitely obliged to you dearest dearest william,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q926,i will go to my uncle my uncle ought to know it as soon as possible,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q927,don t mr crawford pray don t i beg you would not this is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me i must go away i cannot bear it,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q928,no no no this is all nonsense do not distress me i can hear no more of this your kindness to william makes me more obliged to you than words can express but i do not want i cannot bear i must not listen to such no no don t think of me but you are not thinking of me i know it is all nothing,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q929,now william would be able to keep himself which would make a vast difference to his uncle for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle and indeed it would make some difference in her presents too she was very glad that she had given william what she did at parting very glad indeed that it had been in her power without material inconvenience just at that time to give him something rather considerable that is for her with her limited means for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin she knew he must be at some expense that he would have many things to buy though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it,Mrs. Norris,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q930,i am glad you gave him something considerable for i gave him only 10,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q931,indeed upon my word he must have gone off with his pockets well lined and at no expense for his journey to london either,Mrs. Norris,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q932,sir thomas told me 10 would be enough,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q933,it is amazing how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they little think how much it comes to or what their parents or their uncles and aunts pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them all together i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what i do for them,Mrs. Norris,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q934,very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having i wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two shawls fanny,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q935,have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q936,oh yes certainly i will write directly,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Lady Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q937,you cannot think i mean to hurry you you cannot think i have any such object do not hurry yourself i entreat,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q938,oh i thank you i have quite done just done it will be ready in a moment i am very much obliged to you if you will be so good as to give that to miss crawford,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q939,why have you no fire to day,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q940,i am not cold sir i never sit here long at this time of year,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q941,but you have a fire in general,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q942,no sir,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q943,how comes this about here must be some mistake i understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable in your bedchamber i know you cannot have a fire here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified it is highly unfit for you to sit be it only half an hour a day without a fire you are not strong you are chilly your aunt cannot be aware of this,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q944,i understand i understand your aunt norris has always been an advocate and very judiciously for young people s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences but there should be moderation in everything she is also very hardy herself which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others and on another account too i can perfectly comprehend i know what her sentiments have always been the principle was good in itself but it may have been and i believe has been carried too far in your case i am aware that there has been sometimes in some points a misplaced distinction but i think too well of you fanny to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account you have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part and judging partially by the event you will take in the whole of the past you will consider times persons and probabilities and you will feel that they were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which seemed to be your lot though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary it was kindly meant and of this you may be assured that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed i am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you by failing at any time to treat your aunt norris with the respect and attention that are due to her but enough of this sit down my dear i must speak to you for a few minutes but i will not detain you long,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q945,you are not aware perhaps that i have had a visitor this morning i had not been long in my own room after breakfast when mr crawford was shewn in his errand you may probably conjecture,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q946,and now fanny having performed one part of my commission and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory i may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs where though i cannot but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself i must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to mr crawford as you have perhaps foreseen is yet in the house he is in my room and hoping to see you there,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q947,oh no sir i cannot indeed i cannot go down to him mr crawford ought to know he must know that i told him enough yesterday to convince him he spoke to me on this subject yesterday and i told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me and quite out of my power to return his good opinion,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q948,i do not catch your meaning out of your power to return his good opinion what is all this i know he spoke to you yesterday and as far as i understand received as much encouragement to proceed as a well judging young woman could permit herself to give i was very much pleased with what i collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion it shewed a discretion highly to be commended but now when he has made his overtures so properly and honourably what are your scruples now,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q949,you are mistaken sir you are quite mistaken how could mr crawford say such a thing i gave him no encouragement yesterday on the contrary i told him i cannot recollect my exact words but i am sure i told him that i would not listen to him that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect and that i begged him never to talk to me in that manner again i am sure i said as much as that and more and i should have said still more if i had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously but i did not like to be i could not bear to be imputing more than might be intended i thought it might all pass for nothing with him,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q950,am i to understand that you mean to refuse mr crawford,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q951,yes sir,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q952,refuse him,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q953,yes sir,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q954,refuse mr crawford upon what plea for what reason,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q955,i i cannot like him sir well enough to marry him,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q956,this is very strange there is something in this which my comprehension does not reach here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you with everything to recommend him not merely situation in life fortune and character but with more than common agreeableness with address and conversation pleasing to everybody and he is not an acquaintance of to day you have now known him some time his sister moreover is your intimate friend and he has been doing that for your brother which i should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you had there been no other it is very uncertain when my interest might have got william on he has done it already,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q957,yes,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q958,you must have been aware you must have been some time aware of a particularity in mr crawford s manners to you this cannot have taken you by surprise you must have observed his attentions and though you always received them very properly i have no accusation to make on that head i never perceived them to be unpleasant to you i am half inclined to think fanny that you do not quite know your own feelings,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q959,oh yes sir indeed i do his attentions were always what i did not like,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q960,this is beyond me this requires explanation young as you are and having seen scarcely any one it is hardly possible that your affections,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q961,no no i know that is quite out of the question quite impossible well there is nothing more to be said,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q962,independently of the interest which mr crawford s choice seemed to justify his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me i am an advocate for early marriages where there are means in proportion and would have every young man with a sufficient income settle as soon after four and twenty as he can this is so much my opinion that i am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son your cousin mr bertram is to marry early but at present as far as i can judge matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts i wish he were more likely to fix edmund i consider from his dispositions and habits as much more likely to marry early than his brother he indeed i have lately thought has seen the woman he could love which i am convinced my eldest son has not am i right do you agree with me my dear,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q963,yes sir,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q964,have you any reason child to think ill of mr crawford s temper,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q965,no sir,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q966,it is of no use i perceive to talk to you we had better put an end to this most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting i will therefore only add as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct that you have disappointed every expectation i had formed and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what i had supposed for i had fanny as i think my behaviour must have shewn formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to england i had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days even in young women and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence but you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse that you can and will decide for yourself without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you without even asking their advice you have shewn yourself very very different from anything that i had imagined the advantage or disadvantage of your family of your parents your brothers and sisters never seems to have had a moment s share in your thoughts on this occasion how they might be benefited how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you is nothing to you you think only of yourself and because you do not feel for mr crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness you resolve to refuse him at once without wishing even for a little time to consider of it a little more time for cool consideration and for really examining your own inclinations and are in a wild fit of folly throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled as will probably never occur to you again here is a young man of sense of character of temper of manners and of fortune exceedingly attached to you and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way and let me tell you fanny that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half mr crawford s estate or a tenth part of his merits gladly would i have bestowed either of my own daughters on him maria is nobly married but had mr crawford sought julia s hand i should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than i gave maria s to mr rushworth and i should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this immediately and peremptorily and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation put a decided negative on it i should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding i should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect you are not to be judged by the same rule you do not owe me the duty of a child but fanny if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q967,i am very sorry i am very sorry indeed,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q968,sorry yes i hope you are sorry and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day s transactions,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q969,if it were possible for me to do otherwise but i am so perfectly convinced that i could never make him happy and that i should be miserable myself,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q970,well well child dry up your tears there is no use in these tears they can do no good you must now come downstairs with me mr crawford has been kept waiting too long already you must give him your own answer we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments which unfortunately for himself he certainly has imbibed i am totally unequal to it,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q971,mr crawford is gone he has just left me i need not repeat what has passed i do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling by an account of what he has felt suffice it that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding heart and temper upon my representation of what you were suffering he immediately and with the greatest delicacy ceased to urge to see you for the present,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q972,of course it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone be it only for five minutes a request too natural a claim too just to be denied but there is no time fixed perhaps to morrow or whenever your spirits are composed enough for the present you have only to tranquillise yourself check these tears they do but exhaust you if as i am willing to suppose you wish to shew me any observance you will not give way to these emotions but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind i advise you to go out the air will do you good go out for an hour on the gravel you will have the shrubbery to yourself and will be the better for air and exercise and fanny i shall make no mention below of what has passed i shall not even tell your aunt bertram there is no occasion for spreading the disappointment say nothing about it yourself,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q973,i must be a brute indeed if i can be really ungrateful heaven defend me from being ungrateful,Fanny Price,[]
Q974,if i had known you were going out i should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for nanny which i have since to my very great inconvenience been obliged to go and carry myself i could very ill spare the time and you might have saved me the trouble if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out it would have made no difference to you i suppose whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q975,i recommended the shrubbery to fanny as the driest place,Sir Thomas,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q976,oh that was very kind of you sir thomas but you do not know how dry the path is to my house fanny would have had quite as good a walk there i assure you with the advantage of being of some use and obliging her aunt it is all her fault if she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about fanny i have often observed it before she likes to go her own way to work she does not like to be dictated to she takes her own independent walk whenever she can she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy and independence and nonsense about her which i would advise her to get the better of,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Sir Thomas']"
Q977,sir thomas wishes to speak with you ma am in his own room,Baddeley,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q978,stay stay fanny what are you about where are you going don t be in such a hurry depend upon it it is not you who are wanted depend upon it it is me but you are so very eager to put yourself forward what should sir thomas want you for it is me baddeley you mean i am coming this moment you mean me baddeley i am sure sir thomas wants me not miss price,Mrs. Norris,"['Fanny Price', 'Baddeley']"
Q979,no ma am it is miss price i am certain of its being miss price,Baddeley,"['Fanny Price', 'Mrs. Norris']"
Q980,well fanny i have seen mr crawford again and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you he is a most extraordinary young man and whatever be the event you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character though young as you are and little acquainted with the transient varying unsteady nature of love as it generally exists you cannot be struck as i am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement with him it is entirely a matter of feeling he claims no merit in it perhaps is entitled to none yet having chosen so well his constancy has a respectable stamp had his choice been less unexceptionable i should have condemned his persevering,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q981,indeed sir i am very sorry that mr crawford should continue to i know that it is paying me a very great compliment and i feel most undeservedly honoured but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told him so that it never will be in my power,Fanny Price,['Sir Thomas']
Q982,my dear there is no occasion for this your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing more to be said or done from this hour the subject is never to be revived between us you will have nothing to fear or to be agitated about you cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations your happiness and advantage are all that i have in view and nothing is required of you but to bear with mr crawford s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his he proceeds at his own risk you are on safe ground i have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred you will see him with the rest of us in the same manner and as much as you can dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant he leaves northamptonshire so soon that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded the future must be very uncertain and now my dear fanny this subject is closed between us,Sir Thomas,['Fanny Price']
Q983,well fanny well fanny i have had a very agreeable surprise this morning i must just speak of it once i told sir thomas i must once and then i shall have done i give you joy my dear niece,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q984,humph we certainly are a handsome family,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q985,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that,Fanny Price,['Lady Bertram']
Q986,no my dear i should not think of missing you when such an offer as this comes in your way i could do very well without you if you were married to a man of such good estate as mr crawford and you must be aware fanny that it is every young woman s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q987,i will tell you what fanny i am sure he fell in love with you at the ball i am sure the mischief was done that evening you did look remarkably well everybody said so sir thomas said so and you know you had chapman to help you to dress i am very glad i sent chapman to you i shall tell sir thomas that i am sure it was done that evening,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q988,and i will tell you what fanny which is more than i did for maria the next time pug has a litter you shall have a puppy,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q989,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q990,let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship i shall find it immediately,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q991,that play must be a favourite with you you read as if you knew it well,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q992,it will be a favourite i believe from this hour but i do not think i have had a volume of shakespeare in my hand before since i was fifteen i once saw henry the eighth acted or i have heard of it from somebody who did i am not certain which but shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how it is a part of an englishman s constitution his thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere one is intimate with him by instinct no man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q993,no doubt one is familiar with shakespeare in a degree from one s earliest years his celebrated passages are quoted by everybody they are in half the books we open and we all talk shakespeare use his similes and describe with his descriptions but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q994,sir you do me honour,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q995,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q996,you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk,Lady Bertram,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Edmund']"
Q997,do you ma am no no that will never be your ladyship is quite mistaken no theatre at everingham oh no,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q998,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise,Edmund,"['Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram']"
Q999,our liturgy has beauties which not even a careless slovenly style of reading can destroy but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt for myself at least i must confess being not always so attentive as i ought to be,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1000,that nineteen times out of twenty i am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read and longing to have it to read myself did you speak,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1001,no,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1002,are you sure you did not speak i saw your lips move i fancied you might be going to tell me i ought to be more attentive and not allow my thoughts to wander are not you going to tell me so,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1003,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing,Fanny Price,"['Henry Crawford', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1004,a sermon well delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to compose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of the pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers on subjects limited and long worn threadbare in all common hands who can say anything new or striking anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1005,i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to the educated to those who were capable of estimating my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy,Henry Crawford,"['Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Edmund']"
Q1006,what did that shake of the head mean what was it meant to express disapprobation i fear but of what what had i been saying to displease you did you think me speaking improperly lightly irreverently on the subject only tell me if i was only tell me if i was wrong i want to be set right nay nay i entreat you for one moment put down your work what did that shake of the head mean,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1007,how can you sir you quite astonish me i wonder how you can,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q1008,do i astonish you do you wonder is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand i will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner all that gives me an interest in what you look and do and excites my present curiosity i will not leave you to wonder long,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1009,you shook your head at my acknowledging that i should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy yes that was the word constancy i am not afraid of the word i would spell it read it write it with anybody i see nothing alarming in the word did you think i ought,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1010,perhaps sir perhaps sir i thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment,Fanny Price,['Henry Crawford']
Q1011,well i am happier than i was because i now understand more clearly your opinion of me you think me unsteady easily swayed by the whim of the moment easily tempted easily put aside with such an opinion no wonder that but we shall see it is not by protestations that i shall endeavour to convince you i am wronged it is not by telling you that my affections are steady my conduct shall speak for me absence distance time shall speak for me they shall prove that as far as you can be deserved by anybody i do deserve you you are infinitely my superior in merit all that i know you have qualities which i had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature you have some touches of the angel in you beyond what not merely beyond what one sees because one never sees anything like it but beyond what one fancies might be but still i am not frightened it is not by equality of merit that you can be won that is out of the question it is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest who loves you most devotedly that has the best right to a return there i build my confidence by that right i do and will deserve you and when once convinced that my attachment is what i declare it i know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes yes dearest sweetest fanny nay forgive me perhaps i have as yet no right but by what other name can i call you do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other no it is fanny that i think of all day and dream of all night you have given the name such reality of sweetness that nothing else can now be descriptive of you,Henry Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1012,i will speak to her sir i will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone,Edmund,['Sir Thomas']
Q1013,i am come to walk with you fanny shall i it is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1014,but fanny in order to have a comfortable walk something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together you must talk to me i know you have something on your mind i know what you are thinking of you cannot suppose me uninformed am i to hear of it from everybody but fanny herself,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1015,if you hear of it from everybody cousin there can be nothing for me to tell,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1016,not of facts perhaps but of feelings fanny no one but you can tell me them i do not mean to press you however if it is not what you wish yourself i have done i had thought it might be a relief,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1017,i am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what i feel,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1018,do you suppose that we think differently i have no idea of it i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be to the point i consider crawford s proposals as most advantageous and desirable if you could return his affection i consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it but that as you cannot you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him can there be any disagreement between us here,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1019,oh no but i thought you blamed me i thought you were against me this is such a comfort,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1020,this comfort you might have had sooner fanny had you sought it but how could you possibly suppose me against you how could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love were i even careless in general on such matters how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1021,my uncle thought me wrong and i knew he had been talking to you,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1022,as far as you have gone fanny i think you perfectly right i may be sorry i may be surprised though hardly that for you had not had time to attach yourself but i think you perfectly right can it admit of a question it is disgraceful to us if it does you did not love him nothing could have justified your accepting him,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1023,so far your conduct has been faultless and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise but the matter does not end here crawford s is no common attachment he perseveres with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before this we know must be a work of time but,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1024,let him succeed at last fanny let him succeed at last you have proved yourself upright and disinterested prove yourself grateful and tender hearted and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which i have always believed you born for,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1025,oh never never never he never will succeed with me,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1026,never fanny so very determined and positive this is not like yourself your rational self,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1027,i mean that i think i never shall as far as the future can be answered for i think i never shall return his regard,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1028,i must hope better things i am aware more aware than crawford can be that the man who means to make you love him you having due notice of his intentions must have very uphill work for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate which so many years growth have confirmed and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation i know that the apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for a time be arming you against him i wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do fanny between us i think we should have won you my theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as i firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1029,we are so totally unlike we are so very very different in all our inclinations and ways that i consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together even if i could like him there never were two people more dissimilar we have not one taste in common we should be miserable,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1030,you are mistaken fanny the dissimilarity is not so strong you are quite enough alike you have tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in common you have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions you forget yourself there is a decided difference in your tempers i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheerfulness will counteract this he sees difficulties nowhere and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike fanny does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together do not imagine it i am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination for much or little company in the propensity to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i exclude extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme a counteraction gentle and continual is the best safeguard of manners and conduct,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1031,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1032,my dear fanny let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong crawford was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest were blameless i was playing the fool with my eyes open,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1033,as a bystander perhaps i saw more than you did and i do think that mr rushworth was sometimes very jealous,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1034,very possibly no wonder nothing could be more improper than the whole business i am shocked whenever i think that maria could be capable of it but if she could undertake the part we must not be surprised at the rest,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1035,before the play i am much mistaken if julia did not think he was paying her attentions,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1036,julia i have heard before from some one of his being in love with julia but i could never see anything of it and fanny though i hope i do justice to my sisters good qualities i think it very possible that they might one or both be more desirous of being admired by crawford and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent i can remember that they were evidently fond of his society and with such encouragement a man like crawford lively and it may be a little unthinking might be led on to there could be nothing very striking because it is clear that he had no pretensions his heart was reserved for you and i must say that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion it does him the highest honour it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment it proves him unspoilt by his uncle it proves him in short everything that i had been used to wish to believe him and feared he was not,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1037,i am persuaded that he does not think as he ought on serious subjects,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1038,say rather that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects which i believe to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the disadvantages indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are crawford s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed with rare felicity he will make you happy fanny i know he will make you happy but you will make him everything,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1039,i would not engage in such a charge in such an office of high responsibility,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1040,as usual believing yourself unequal to anything fancying everything too much for you well though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sincerely anxious that you may i have no common interest in crawford s well doing next to your happiness fanny his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in crawford,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1041,i was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you fanny just as she ought she desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it i should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1042,was mrs grant in the room then,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1043,yes when i reached the house i found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you fanny till crawford and dr grant came in,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1044,it is above a week since i saw miss crawford,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1045,yes she laments it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you fanny you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and esteems you with all her heart,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1046,i knew she would be very angry with me,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1047,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1048,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1049,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1050,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1051,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1052,they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1053,you were near staying there,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1054,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1055,you spent your time pleasantly there,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1056,yes that is it was the fault of my own mind if i did not they were all very pleasant i doubt their finding me so i took uneasiness with me and there was no getting rid of it till i was in mansfield again,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1057,the miss owens you liked them did not you,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1058,yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two distinct orders of being you and miss crawford have made me too nice,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1059,i must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1060,sad sad girl i do not know when i shall have done scolding you,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1061,ha am i here again the east room once only was i in this room before,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1062,once only before do you remember it i came to rehearse your cousin came too and we had a rehearsal you were our audience and prompter a delightful rehearsal i shall never forget it here we were just in this part of the room here was your cousin here was i here were the chairs oh why will such things ever pass away,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1063,the scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable the subject of it so very very what shall i say he was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me i think i see him now trying to be as demure and composed as anhalt ought through the two long speeches when two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state matrimony may be called a happy life i suppose no time can ever wear out the impression i have of his looks and voice as he said those words it was curious very curious that we should have such a scene to play if i had the power of recalling any one week of my existence it should be that week that acting week say what you would fanny it should be that for i never knew such exquisite happiness in any other his sturdy spirit to bend as it did oh it was sweet beyond expression but alas that very evening destroyed it all that very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle poor sir thomas who was glad to see you yet fanny do not imagine i would now speak disrespectfully of sir thomas though i certainly did hate him for many a week no i do him justice now he is just what the head of such a family should be nay in sober sadness i believe i now love you all,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1064,i have had a little fit since i came into this room as you may perceive but it is over now so let us sit down and be comfortable for as to scolding you fanny which i came fully intending to do i have not the heart for it when it comes to the point good gentle fanny when i think of this being the last time of seeing you for i do not know how long i feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1065,i hate to leave you i shall see no one half so amiable where i am going who says we shall not be sisters i know we shall i feel that we are born to be connected and those tears convince me that you feel it too dear fanny,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1066,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q1067,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1068,how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1069,why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1070,excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it perfectly,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1071,do you mean then that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand oh miss crawford that was not fair,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q1072,knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1073,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q1074,ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad flirt and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies affections i have often scolded him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for and then fanny the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1075,i cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman s feelings and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander by can judge of,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q1076,i do not defend him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at everingham i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never been addicted to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before that he loves you with all his heart and will love you as nearly for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman for ever i think henry will do as much for you,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1077,i cannot imagine henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1078,oh yes how very very kind of him,Fanny Price,['Mary Crawford']
Q1079,i know he must have exerted himself very much for i know the parties he had to move the admiral hates trouble and scorns asking favours and there are so many young men s claims to be attended to in the same way that a friendship and energy not very determined is easily put by what a happy creature william must be i wish we could see him,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']
Q1080,i should like to sit talking with you here all day but we must not forget the ladies below and so good bye my dear my amiable my excellent fanny for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast parlour i must take leave of you here and i do take leave longing for a happy reunion and trusting that when we meet again it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve,Mary Crawford,['Fanny Price']

Q1140,dear fanny now i shall be comfortable,Lady Bertram,['Fanny Price']
Q1141,said she i could not answer but i believe my looks spoke she felt reproved sometimes how quick to feel with a graver look and voice she then added,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1142,so she began but how she went on fanny is not fit is hardly fit to be repeated to you i cannot recall all her words i would not dwell upon them if i could their substance was great anger at the folly of each she reprobated her brother s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for to do what must lose him the woman he adored but still more the folly of poor maria in sacrificing such a situation plunging into such difficulties under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear guess what i must have felt to hear the woman whom no harsher name than folly given so voluntarily so freely so coolly to canvass it no reluctance no horror no feminine shall i say no modest loathings this is what the world does for where fanny shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed spoilt spoilt,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1143,i will tell you everything and then have done for ever she saw it only as folly and that folly stamped only by exposure the want of common discretion of caution his going down to richmond for the whole time of her being at twickenham her putting herself in the power of a servant it was the detection in short oh fanny it was the detection not the offence which she reprobated it was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1144,and what what could you say cruel quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty,Fanny Price,['Edmund']

Q1147,my dearest fanny i am giving you i hope more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been but what never can be now you do not wish me to be silent if you do give me but a look a word and i have done,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1148,thank god now fanny she tried to speak carelessly but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear i only said in reply that from my heart i wished her well and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty to the lessons of affliction and immediately left the room i had gone a few steps fanny when i heard the door open behind me said she i looked back said she with a smile but it was a smile ill suited to the conversation that had passed a saucy playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue me at least it appeared so to me i resisted it was the impulse of the moment to resist and still walked on i have since sometimes for a moment regretted that i did not go back but i know i was right and such has been the end of our acquaintance and what an acquaintance has it been how have i been deceived equally in brother and sister deceived i thank you for your patience fanny this has been the greatest relief and now we will have done,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1149,we were all disposed to wonder but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer she spoke of you with high praise and warm affection yet even here there was alloy a dash of evil for in the midst of it she could exclaim could you have believed it possible but the charm is broken my eyes are opened,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1150,cruelty do you call it we differ there no hers is not a cruel nature i do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings the evil lies yet deeper in her total ignorance unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did she was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak as she imagined everybody else would speak hers are not faults of temper she would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one and though i may deceive myself i cannot but think that for me for my feelings she would hers are faults of principle fanny of blunted delicacy and a corrupted vitiated mind perhaps it is best for me since it leaves me so little to regret not so however gladly would i submit to all the increased pain of losing her rather than have to think of her as i do i told her so,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1151,did you,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1152,yes when i left her i told her so,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1153,how long were you together,Fanny Price,['Edmund']
Q1154,five and twenty minutes well she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them she spoke of it fanny with a steadier voice than i can,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1155,said she,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
Q1156,i shall soon have done i have told you the substance of all that she said as soon as i could speak i replied that i had not supposed it possible coming in such a state of mind into that house as i had done that anything could occur to make me suffer more but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence that though i had in the course of our acquaintance been often sensible of some difference in our opinions on points too of some moment it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it that the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister with whom lay the greater seduction i pretended not to say but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself giving it every reproach but the right considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong and last of all and above all recommending to us a compliance a compromise an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin on the chance of a marriage which thinking as i now thought of her brother should rather be prevented than sought all this together most grievously convinced me that i had never understood her before and that as far as related to mind it had been the creature of my own imagination not miss crawford that i had been too apt to dwell on for many months past that perhaps it was best for me i had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship feelings hopes which must at any rate have been torn from me now and yet that i must and would confess that could i have restored her to what she had appeared to me before i would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem this is what i said the purport of it but as you may imagine not spoken so collectedly or methodically as i have repeated it to you she was astonished exceedingly astonished more than astonished i saw her change countenance she turned extremely red i imagined i saw a mixture of many feelings a great though short struggle half a wish of yielding to truths half a sense of shame but habit habit carried it she would have laughed if she could it was a sort of laugh as she answered,Edmund,['Fanny Price']
