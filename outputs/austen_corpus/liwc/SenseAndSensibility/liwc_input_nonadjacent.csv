p00000_A,00000,A,you may esteem him
p00001_A,00001,A,as for the house itself to be sure it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly
p00002_A,00002,A,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
p00003_A,00003,A,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
p00004_A,00004,A,had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess marianne is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever
p00005_A,00005,A,i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time
p00006_A,00006,A,and what sort of a young man is he
p00007_A,00007,A,and is that all you can say for him but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius
p00008_A,00008,A,but who is he where does he come from has he a house at allenham
p00009_A,00009,A,i do not believe that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible
p00010_A,00010,A,that is an expression sir john which i particularly dislike i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one s cap at a man or making a conquest are the most odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity
p00011_A,00011,A,ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles
p00012_A,00012,A,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask
p00013_A,00013,A,my love you must not be offended with elinor she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend
p00014_A,00014,A,brandon is just the kind of man whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to
p00015_A,00015,A,that is exactly what i think of him
p00016_A,00016,A,in defence of your prot g you can even be saucy
p00017_A,00017,A,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
p00018_A,00018,A,i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him
p00019_A,00019,A,i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body s good word and nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year
p00020_A,00020,A,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression
p00021_A,00021,A,miss dashwood you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever
p00022_A,00022,A,take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his
p00023_A,00023,A,remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them
p00024_A,00024,A,yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say
p00025_A,00025,A,well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f
p00026_A,00026,A,what is the matter with brandon
p00027_A,00027,A,no ma am it came from town and is merely a letter of business
p00028_A,00028,A,my dear madam recollect what you are saying
p00029_A,00029,A,in town what can you have to do in town at this time of year
p00030_A,00030,A,my own loss is great in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell
p00031_A,00031,A,but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon will it not be sufficient
p00032_A,00032,A,we must go it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all
p00033_A,00033,A,i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day
p00034_A,00034,A,if you would but let us know what your business is we might see whether it could be put off or not
p00035_A,00035,A,i cannot afford to lose one hour
p00036_A,00036,A,there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of old when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell well then when will you come back again
p00037_A,00037,A,i hope we shall see you at barton as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return
p00038_A,00038,A,you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
p00039_A,00039,A,ay so do sir john and then perhaps you may find out what his business is
p00040_A,00040,A,well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind
p00041_A,00041,A,i am afraid none at all
p00042_A,00042,A,then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do
p00043_A,00043,A,come colonel before you go do let us know what you are going about
p00044_A,00044,A,and who is miss williams
p00045_A,00045,A,what do not you know who miss williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel s my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies
p00046_A,00046,A,indeed
p00047_A,00047,A,i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning
p00048_A,00048,A,where pray
p00049_A,00049,A,did not you know that we had been out in my curricle
p00050_A,00050,A,yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
p00051_A,00051,A,i flatter myself that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this
p00052_A,00052,A,there certainly are circumstances which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share how often did i wish when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford you are a good woman your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me
p00053_A,00053,A,shall we see you tomorrow to dinner i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton
p00054_A,00054,A,my engagements at present are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy
p00055_A,00055,A,why do you not ask marianne at once whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially
p00056_A,00056,A,we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens
p00057_A,00057,A,months no nor many weeks
p00058_A,00058,A,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air
p00059_A,00059,A,he has he has i am sure he has his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come
p00060_A,00060,A,a fortnight
p00061_A,00061,A,have you been lately in sussex
p00062_A,00062,A,i was at norland about a month ago
p00063_A,00063,A,it is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves
p00064_A,00064,A,have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the middletons pleasant people
p00065_A,00065,A,no nor how many painful moments
p00066_A,00066,A,you have no ambition i well know your wishes are all moderate
p00067_A,00067,A,as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way greatness will not make me so
p00068_A,00068,A,two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end
p00069_A,00069,A,hunters but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt
p00070_A,00070,A,i wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece
p00071_A,00071,A,oh that they would
p00072_A,00072,A,we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
p00073_A,00073,A,oh dear how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it
p00074_A,00074,A,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help
p00075_A,00075,A,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish
p00076_A,00076,A,perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume
p00077_A,00077,A,undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them
p00078_A,00078,A,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered
p00079_A,00079,A,nay edward you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself
p00080_A,00080,A,i believe you are right and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl
p00081_A,00081,A,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure
p00082_A,00082,A,marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers
p00083_A,00083,A,yes very
p00084_A,00084,A,do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
p00085_A,00085,A,you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
p00086_A,00086,A,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
p00087_A,00087,A,you must drink tea with us to night for we shall be quite alone and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party
p00088_A,00088,A,a dance impossible who is to dance
p00089_A,00089,A,who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone
p00090_A,00090,A,i wish with all my soul that willoughby were among us again
p00091_A,00091,A,well what a delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming only think mama how it is improved since i was here last i always thought it such a sweet place ma am turning to mrs dashwood but you have made it so charming only look sister how delightful every thing is how i should like such a house for myself should not you mr palmer mr palmer does not hear me he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous
p00092_A,00092,A,you may believe how glad we all were to see them but however i can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some business for you know it was wrong in her situation i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all she expects to be confined in february
p00093_A,00093,A,no none at all
p00094_A,00094,A,oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever my love have you been asleep
p00095_A,00095,A,how horrid all this is such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain it makes one detest all one s acquaintance what the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his house how few people know what comfort is sir john is as stupid as the weather
p00096_A,00096,A,i am afraid miss marianne you have not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today
p00097_A,00097,A,as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life
p00098_A,00098,A,is it very ugly then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose
p00099_A,00099,A,my dear it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
p00100_A,00100,A,did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last
p00101_A,00101,A,you and i sir john should not stand upon such ceremony
p00102_A,00102,A,my love you contradict every body do you know that you are quite rude
p00103_A,00103,A,i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother ill bred
p00104_A,00104,A,ay you may abuse me as you please you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you
p00105_A,00105,A,no i never said any thing so irrational don t palm all your abuses of language upon me
p00106_A,00106,A,john is in such spirits today he is full of monkey tricks how playful william is and here is my sweet little annamaria and she is always so gentle and quiet never was there such a quiet little thing
p00107_A,00107,A,poor little creatures it might have been a very sad accident
p00108_A,00108,A,yet i hardly know how unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality
p00109_A,00109,A,what a sweet woman lady middleton is
p00110_A,00110,A,and sir john too what a charming man he is and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
p00111_A,00111,A,i have a notion you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
p00112_A,00112,A,i confess that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence
p00113_A,00113,A,and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
p00114_A,00114,A,we have heard sir john admire it excessively
p00115_A,00115,A,i think every one must admire it who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
p00116_A,00116,A,but why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex
p00117_A,00117,A,upon my word i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
p00118_A,00118,A,his name is ferrars but pray do not tell it for it s a great secret
p00119_A,00119,A,ferrars mr ferrars is the happy man is he what your sister in law s brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well
p00120_A,00120,A,i did
p00121_A,00121,A,indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
p00122_A,00122,A,you are very good i hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring the bell for some working candles my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done
p00123_A,00123,A,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
p00124_A,00124,A,marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard
p00125_A,00125,A,perhaps if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it
p00126_A,00126,A,indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all
p00127_A,00127,A,oh that would be terrible indeed dear little soul how i do love her
p00128_A,00128,A,you are very kind and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
p00129_A,00129,A,edward s love for me has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived
p00130_A,00130,A,a great coxcomb oh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say
p00131_A,00131,A,no sister you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs
p00132_A,00132,A,i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
p00133_A,00133,A,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s
p00134_A,00134,A,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it
p00135_A,00135,A,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle
p00136_A,00136,A,my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence
p00137_A,00137,A,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
p00138_A,00138,A,i will have you both go these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family
p00139_A,00139,A,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not
p00140_A,00140,A,mr palmer will be so happy to see you what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mama i forget what it was now but it was something so droll
p00141_A,00141,A,if this open weather holds much longer sir john will not like leaving barton next week tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem to take it so much to heart
p00142_A,00142,A,that is true i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country it is charming weather for them indeed how much they must enjoy it but it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight
p00143_A,00143,A,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way
p00144_A,00144,A,no ma am for my mistress
p00145_A,00145,A,nor i our situations then are alike we have neither of us any thing to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal nothing
p00146_A,00146,A,i do not know
p00147_A,00147,A,so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him somewhere in the street this morning
p00148_A,00148,A,by many by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer and the middletons but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to mr willoughby in your sister s writing i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every thing finally settled is it impossible to but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her
p00149_A,00149,A,yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me
p00150_A,00150,A,no elinor ask nothing you will soon know all
p00151_A,00151,A,how do you do my dear how is she miss dashwood poor thing she looks very bad no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be married very soon a good for nothing fellow i have no patience with him mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was said i and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it i have no notion of men s going on in this way and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day but there is one comfort my dear miss marianne he is not the only young man in the world worth having and with your pretty face you will never want admirers well poor thing i won t disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her
p00152_A,00152,A,no no no it cannot be she cannot feel her kindness is not sympathy her good nature is not tenderness all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it
p00153_A,00153,A,now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good
p00154_A,00154,A,i will not trust to that a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others
p00155_A,00155,A,i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still but i always thought i should i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word
p00156_A,00156,A,aye aye that is very pretty talking but it won t do the doctor is the man i see
p00157_A,00157,A,no indeed and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of
p00158_A,00158,A,no i do not think we shall
p00159_A,00159,A,oh yes i dare say you will what a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together
p00160_A,00160,A,long a time indeed why their visit is but just begun
p00161_A,00161,A,oh dear that is a great pity but such old friends as lucy and me i think she might see us and i am sure we would not speak a word oh if that s all we can just as well go and see her
p00162_A,00162,A,these are done by my eldest sister and you as a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well
p00163_A,00163,A,they are very pretty ma am an t they do you not think they are something in miss morton s style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
p00164_A,00164,A,miss morton is lord morton s daughter
p00165_A,00165,A,ah poor dear
p00166_A,00166,A,i was engaged elsewhere
p00167_A,00167,A,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
p00168_A,00168,A,not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure he is the most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish of any body i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it what are you never to hear yourself praised then you must be no friend of mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation going so soon my dear edward this must not be
p00169_A,00169,A,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly
p00170_A,00170,A,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy
p00171_A,00171,A,gracious god can this be possible
p00172_A,00172,A,get it all out of her my dear she will tell you any thing if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke
p00173_A,00173,A,wait for his having a living ay we all know how that will end they will wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can give her then they will have a child every year and lord help em how poor they will be i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house two maids and two men indeed as i talked of t other day no no they must get a stout girl of all works betty s sister would never do for them now very well indeed how prettily she writes aye that was quite proper to let him be off if he would that was just like lucy poor soul i wish i could get him a living with all my heart she calls me you see she is a good hearted girl as ever lived very well upon my word that sentence is very prettily turned yes yes i will go and see her sure enough how attentive she is to think of every body thank you my dear for showing it me it is as pretty a letter as ever i saw and does lucy s head and heart great credit
p00174_A,00174,A,i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
p00175_A,00175,A,this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
p00176_A,00176,A,the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i shan t go if lucy an t there
p00177_A,00177,A,certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son and as to any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior to the other of one thing my dear sister i may assure you and i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it but i have it from the very best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself but her daughter did and i have it from her that in short whatever objections there might be against a certain a certain connection you understand me it would have been far preferable to her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all she said and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse but however all that is quite out of the question not to be thought of or mentioned as to any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered has colonel brandon been with you lately
p00178_A,00178,A,yes once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved
p00179_A,00179,A,but she must not go round by london i shall never see her if she goes by london
p00180_A,00180,A,but she will be gained by some one else and if that some one should be the very he whom of all others i could least bear but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill by showing that where i have most injured i can least forgive good bye god bless you
p00181_A,00181,A,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one
p00182_A,00182,A,our situations have borne little resemblance
p00183_A,00183,A,i know it i know it happy with a man of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt
p00184_A,00184,A,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife
p00185_A,00185,A,i have not a doubt of it and i have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly
p00186_A,00186,A,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents
p00187_A,00187,A,did mrs ferrars look well
p00188_A,00188,A,yes ma am she said how she was very well and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady and she seemed vastly contented
p00189_A,00189,A,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day
p00190_A,00190,A,i meant to enquire for mrs edward ferrars
p00191_A,00191,A,perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to miss lucy steele yes they were married last week and are now at dawlish
p00192_A,00192,A,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be
p00193_A,00193,A,i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself which at present after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering
p00194_A,00194,A,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make
p00000_B,00000,B,in a few months my dear marianne elinor will in all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but she will be happy
p00001_B,00001,B,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
p00002_B,00002,B,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
p00003_B,00003,B,perhaps thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying her
p00004_B,00004,B,had you any idea of his coming so soon i had none on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton does elinor expect him already
p00005_B,00005,B,is there a felicity in the world superior to this margaret we will walk here at least two hours
p00006_B,00006,B,and is that all you can say for him but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius
p00007_B,00007,B,but who is he where does he come from has he a house at allenham
p00008_B,00008,B,i do not believe that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible
p00009_B,00009,B,did he indeed and with elegance with spirit
p00010_B,00010,B,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask
p00011_B,00011,B,elinor is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared
p00012_B,00012,B,my love you must not be offended with elinor she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend
p00013_B,00013,B,that is exactly what i think of him
p00014_B,00014,B,do not boast of it however for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him
p00015_B,00015,B,that he is patronised by you is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else
p00016_B,00016,B,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
p00017_B,00017,B,perhaps his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins
p00018_B,00018,B,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression
p00019_B,00019,B,you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart
p00020_B,00020,B,miss dashwood you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever
p00021_B,00021,B,no her opinions are all romantic
p00022_B,00022,B,i must not tell may i elinor
p00023_B,00023,B,oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it what is the gentleman s name
p00024_B,00024,B,margaret you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence
p00025_B,00025,B,i hope he has had no bad news it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly
p00026_B,00026,B,no bad news colonel i hope
p00027_B,00027,B,my dear madam recollect what you are saying
p00028_B,00028,B,no indeed it is not
p00029_B,00029,B,but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon will it not be sufficient
p00030_B,00030,B,we must go it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all
p00031_B,00031,B,i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day
p00032_B,00032,B,if you would but let us know what your business is we might see whether it could be put off or not
p00033_B,00033,B,you would not be six hours later if you were to defer your journey till our return
p00034_B,00034,B,i cannot afford to lose one hour
p00035_B,00035,B,i have no doubt of it
p00036_B,00036,B,you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
p00037_B,00037,B,oh he must and shall come back if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him
p00038_B,00038,B,ay so do sir john and then perhaps you may find out what his business is
p00039_B,00039,B,no only to honiton i shall then go post
p00040_B,00040,B,i am afraid none at all
p00041_B,00041,B,come colonel before you go do let us know what you are going about
p00042_B,00042,B,i can guess what his business is however yes it is about miss williams i am sure
p00043_B,00043,B,and who is miss williams
p00044_B,00044,B,she is his natural daughter
p00045_B,00045,B,indeed
p00046_B,00046,B,i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning
p00047_B,00047,B,did not you know that we had been out in my curricle
p00048_B,00048,B,yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
p00049_B,00049,B,why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself
p00050_B,00050,B,yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby
p00051_B,00051,B,shall we see you tomorrow to dinner i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton
p00052_B,00052,B,is anything the matter with her is she ill
p00053_B,00053,B,i hope not it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment
p00054_B,00054,B,it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here
p00055_B,00055,B,we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens
p00056_B,00056,B,it is he it is indeed i know it is
p00057_B,00057,B,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air
p00058_B,00058,B,a fortnight
p00059_B,00059,B,have you been lately in sussex
p00060_B,00060,B,i was at norland about a month ago
p00061_B,00061,B,and how does dear dear norland look
p00062_B,00062,B,dear dear norland probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves
p00063_B,00063,B,it is a beautiful country but these bottoms must be dirty in winter
p00064_B,00064,B,marianne how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are a very respectable family mr ferrars and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner have you forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them
p00065_B,00065,B,no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life
p00066_B,00066,B,strange that it would what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness
p00067_B,00067,B,grandeur has but little but wealth has much to do with it
p00068_B,00068,B,hunters but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt
p00069_B,00069,B,i wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece
p00070_B,00070,B,we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
p00071_B,00071,B,oh dear how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it
p00072_B,00072,B,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help
p00073_B,00073,B,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish
p00074_B,00074,B,what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes
p00075_B,00075,B,i love to be reminded of the past edward whether it be melancholy or gay i love to recall it and you will never offend me by talking of former times you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books
p00076_B,00076,B,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered
p00077_B,00077,B,she is only grown a little more grave than she was
p00078_B,00078,B,nay edward you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself
p00079_B,00079,B,nor do i think it a part of marianne s i should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry
p00080_B,00080,B,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure
p00081_B,00081,B,you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility do you gain no ground
p00082_B,00082,B,but you would still be reserved and that is worse
p00083_B,00083,B,do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
p00084_B,00084,B,you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
p00085_B,00085,B,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
p00086_B,00086,B,i am convinced that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower and a troop of tidy happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world
p00087_B,00087,B,a dance impossible who is to dance
p00088_B,00088,B,i wish with all my soul that willoughby were among us again
p00089_B,00089,B,and who is willoughby
p00090_B,00090,B,i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
p00091_B,00091,B,no none at all
p00092_B,00092,B,here comes marianne now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl
p00093_B,00093,B,oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever my love have you been asleep
p00094_B,00094,B,they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere
p00095_B,00095,B,oh don t be so sly before us for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome we do not live a great way from him in the country you know not above ten miles i dare say
p00096_B,00096,B,much nearer thirty
p00097_B,00097,B,my dear it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
p00098_B,00098,B,did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last
p00099_B,00099,B,you and i sir john should not stand upon such ceremony
p00100_B,00100,B,then you would be very ill bred
p00101_B,00101,B,my love you contradict every body do you know that you are quite rude
p00102_B,00102,B,ay you may abuse me as you please you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you
p00103_B,00103,B,mr palmer is so droll he is always out of humour
p00104_B,00104,B,oh my dear miss dashwood i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas now pray do and come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy i shall be it will be quite delightful my love don t you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland
p00105_B,00105,B,certainly he seems very agreeable
p00106_B,00106,B,yet i hardly know how unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality
p00107_B,00107,B,what a sweet woman lady middleton is
p00108_B,00108,B,and sir john too what a charming man he is and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
p00109_B,00109,B,i should guess so from what i have witnessed this morning
p00110_B,00110,B,i have a notion you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
p00111_B,00111,B,and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
p00112_B,00112,B,we have heard sir john admire it excessively
p00113_B,00113,B,i think every one must admire it who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
p00114_B,00114,B,and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always
p00115_B,00115,B,but why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex
p00116_B,00116,B,upon my word i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
p00117_B,00117,B,lord anne you can talk of nothing but beaux you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else
p00118_B,00118,B,how can you say so anne though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well
p00119_B,00119,B,and who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted
p00120_B,00120,B,indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
p00121_B,00121,B,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
p00122_B,00122,B,marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard
p00123_B,00123,B,perhaps if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it
p00124_B,00124,B,indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all
p00125_B,00125,B,oh that would be terrible indeed dear little soul how i do love her
p00126_B,00126,B,you are very kind and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
p00127_B,00127,B,i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its subject i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again
p00128_B,00128,B,thank you for breaking the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday
p00129_B,00129,B,but what are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth
p00130_B,00130,B,i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
p00131_B,00131,B,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s
p00132_B,00132,B,i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest
p00133_B,00133,B,i should always be happy to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough to her husband
p00134_B,00134,B,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle
p00135_B,00135,B,though with your usual anxiety for our happiness you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed
p00136_B,00136,B,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
p00137_B,00137,B,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not
p00138_B,00138,B,i am writing home marianne had not you better defer your letter for a day or two
p00139_B,00139,B,i am not going to write to my mother oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is
p00140_B,00140,B,how odd indeed if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne
p00141_B,00141,B,at any rate i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week
p00142_B,00142,B,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way
p00143_B,00143,B,don t you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor there seems to me a very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon good god he has been here while we were out
p00144_B,00144,B,you are expecting a letter then
p00145_B,00145,B,did you
p00146_B,00146,B,invited
p00147_B,00147,B,it cannot be generally known for her own family do not know it
p00148_B,00148,B,pray pray be composed and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet
p00149_B,00149,B,how can that be done no my dearest marianne you must wait this is not the place for explanations wait only till tomorrow marianne may i ask
p00150_B,00150,B,and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married
p00151_B,00151,B,the lady then miss grey i think you called her is very rich
p00152_B,00152,B,who can this be so early too i thought we had been safe
p00153_B,00153,B,it is colonel brandon we are never safe from him
p00154_B,00154,B,i understand you you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it
p00155_B,00155,B,not in the stage i assure you we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we d join him in a post chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did
p00156_B,00156,B,i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss dashwood when they come to town
p00157_B,00157,B,no i do not think we shall
p00158_B,00158,B,long a time indeed why their visit is but just begun
p00159_B,00159,B,i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood i am sorry she is not well
p00160_B,00160,B,you are very good my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation
p00161_B,00161,B,excellent indeed their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express
p00162_B,00162,B,they are very pretty ma am an t they do you not think they are something in miss morton s style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
p00163_B,00163,B,this is admiration of a very particular kind what is miss morton to us who knows or who cares for her it is elinor of whom we think and speak
p00164_B,00164,B,ah poor dear
p00165_B,00165,B,my dear friend i come to talk to you of my happiness could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars s way of treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she was you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her but the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to me now was not it so you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it
p00166_B,00166,B,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
p00167_B,00167,B,what can bring her here so often could not she see that we wanted her gone how teazing to edward
p00168_B,00168,B,why so we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves
p00169_B,00169,B,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement
p00170_B,00170,B,yes ma am
p00171_B,00171,B,then he has acted like an honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband
p00172_B,00172,B,not at all i believe with you
p00173_B,00173,B,you forget that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of
p00174_B,00174,B,i shall always think myself very much obliged to you
p00175_B,00175,B,thank you ma am it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life
p00176_B,00176,B,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward
p00177_B,00177,B,have you ever seen the lady
p00178_B,00178,B,not yet but she will be here i hope before it is long it is a great way you know from hence to barton
p00179_B,00179,B,no sir i shall not stay your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house
p00180_B,00180,B,colonel brandon s character as an excellent man is well established
p00181_B,00181,B,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy
p00182_B,00182,B,i wish to assure you both that i see every thing as you can desire me to do it is a great relief to me what elinor told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings
p00183_B,00183,B,you consider the matter exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self denial is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties
p00184_B,00184,B,rather say your mother s imprudence my child she must be answerable
p00185_B,00185,B,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents
p00186_B,00186,B,who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas
p00187_B,00187,B,when do you write to colonel brandon ma am
p00188_B,00188,B,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day
p00189_B,00189,B,is mrs ferrars at longstaple
p00190_B,00190,B,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style
p00191_B,00191,B,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her
p00192_B,00192,B,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make
p00193_B,00193,B,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first
p00194_B,00194,B,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit
