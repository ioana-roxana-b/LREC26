p00754_A,00754,A,i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed,1,79.66,70.34,23.73,16.95,5.08,0.85,0.85,10.17,0,6.78,0.85,13.56,14.41,8.47,8.47,1.69,1.69

p00776_A,00776,A,jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do,1,85.61,70.45,19.7,12.88,0.76,1.52,0.76,9.09,0.76,6.82,5.3,12.88,11.36,10.61,13.64,4.55,5.3

p01179_A,01179,A,my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton when frank left us it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next,1,81.25,65.63,23.13,13.13,5,1.88,1.88,3.75,0.63,10,2.5,5.63,14.38,11.88,8.13,1.88,4.38
p01180_A,01180,A,you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him,1,79.84,64.52,14.11,9.68,2.42,2.02,2.02,3.23,0,4.44,6.45,13.31,13.31,7.26,8.06,2.82,6.45
p01181_A,01181,A,i hope i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart,1,77.61,67.16,20.4,16.92,4.48,0.5,1,10.45,0.5,3.48,5.47,13.43,14.43,2.99,8.96,3.98,2.99

p01183_A,01183,A,and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you,1,75,64.06,28.13,20.31,7.81,3.13,7.81,1.56,0,7.81,1.56,9.38,12.5,4.69,4.69,3.13,1.56

p01189_A,01189,A,aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society,1,72.73,63.64,12.12,8.08,5.05,0,1.01,2.02,0,4.04,5.05,15.15,9.09,7.07,7.07,4.04,8.08

p01252_A,01252,A,my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister,1,77.25,67,14.25,11.25,4.25,0.75,2.25,3.25,0.5,3,8,18,10.5,5,7.5,1.75,5.25
p01253_A,01253,A,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends,1,82.56,67.18,18.97,14.36,5.64,0,2.56,4.62,1.03,4.62,4.62,12.82,11.79,7.18,7.18,2.56,5.13

p01318_A,01318,A,ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt s memory which misleads her here she is awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs crawford without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements though the admiral s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely i do not censure her opinions but there certainly is impropriety in making them public,1,69.53,60.94,17.97,12.5,2.34,0,0,8.59,1.56,5.47,4.69,11.72,11.72,6.25,4.69,2.34,2.34
p01319_A,01319,A,that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection,1,78.46,66.15,18.46,12.31,1.54,1.54,0,7.69,1.54,6.15,9.23,12.31,16.92,3.08,3.08,0,3.08
p01320_A,01320,A,i do not want her at all for myself but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home i think miss crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mansfield common mrs grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any morning will do for this she would be extremely sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health,1,82.69,66.35,18.27,14.42,3.85,0,2.88,7.69,0,3.85,2.88,17.31,15.38,4.81,6.73,1.92,4.81

p01323_A,01323,A,not i should hope of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom we do not look in great cities for our best morality it is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt a fine preacher is followed and admired but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character and observing his general conduct which in london can rarely be the case the clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners they are known to the largest part only as preachers and with regard to their influencing public manners miss crawford must not misunderstand me or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulators of refinement and courtesy the masters of the ceremonies of life the manners i speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps the result of good principles the effect in short of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i believe be everywhere found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to be so are the rest of the nation,1,74.46,63.2,12.99,7.36,2.16,0.87,0,1.73,2.6,5.63,9.52,13.85,12.12,5.19,6.49,3.03,2.6

p01326_A,01326,A,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly,1,80.67,67.23,22.69,15.13,12.61,0,1.68,0.84,0,7.56,5.88,8.4,17.65,4.2,5.04,4.2,0.84

p01374_A,01374,A,i must hope better things i am aware more aware than crawford can be that the man who means to make you love him you having due notice of his intentions must have very uphill work for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate which so many years growth have confirmed and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation i know that the apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for a time be arming you against him i wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do fanny between us i think we should have won you my theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as i firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference,1,77.97,63.88,24.67,19.38,5.29,0.88,5.73,7.05,0,5.29,3.52,13.22,14.1,3.08,5.29,1.76,2.64

p01385_A,01385,A,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life,1,78.15,65.56,19.26,15.19,4.07,0.37,4.81,2.59,2.96,4.07,5.56,16.3,9.63,4.81,6.3,0.74,6.3

p01388_A,01388,A,said she i could not answer but i believe my looks spoke she felt reproved sometimes how quick to feel with a graver look and voice she then added so she began but how she went on fanny is not fit is hardly fit to be repeated to you i cannot recall all her words i would not dwell upon them if i could their substance was great anger at the folly of each she reprobated her brother s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for to do what must lose him the woman he adored but still more the folly of poor maria in sacrificing such a situation plunging into such difficulties under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear guess what i must have felt to hear the woman whom no harsher name than folly given so voluntarily so freely so coolly to canvass it no reluctance no horror no feminine shall i say no modest loathings this is what the world does for where fanny shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed spoilt spoilt i will tell you everything and then have done for ever she saw it only as folly and that folly stamped only by exposure the want of common discretion of caution his going down to richmond for the whole time of her being at twickenham her putting herself in the power of a servant it was the detection in short oh fanny it was the detection not the offence which she reprobated it was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her,1,74.32,61.49,17.57,12.84,3.04,0.34,0.68,6.76,0.68,4.73,6.42,13.85,9.46,5.74,5.74,3.72,2.36

p01686_A,01686,A,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me,1,76.62,64.94,14.29,11.69,7.79,0,1.3,0,1.3,2.6,3.9,10.39,11.69,9.09,11.69,0,9.09

p01695_A,01695,A,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me,1,77.38,62.7,16.27,13.1,7.14,0.79,0.79,1.59,2.38,3.17,5.95,14.29,8.73,5.16,9.13,2.38,5.95

p01748_A,01748,A,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it

p02202_A,02202,A,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,1,77.3,69.5,19.86,11.35,1.42,0,2.13,1.42,6.38,8.51,5.67,16.31,8.51,4.96,7.09,1.42,2.84
p02203_A,02203,A,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,1,66.67,59.52,10.71,8.33,1.19,0,1.19,4.76,1.19,2.38,15.48,15.48,9.52,2.38,5.95,0,1.19

p03094_A,03094,A,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,1,72.44,62.21,15.68,10.23,1.49,0.17,2.64,4.95,0.66,5.45,6.27,16.5,9.57,4.79,10.23,1.32,3.47
p03095_A,03095,A,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation,1,67.98,56.18,16.29,12.92,2.81,0,1.69,7.87,0,3.37,5.06,11.8,10.11,2.81,7.3,2.81,2.25
p03096_A,03096,A,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes,1,73.79,61.17,15.53,6.8,0.97,0.97,0,0,4.85,8.74,4.85,13.59,11.65,3.88,6.8,0.97,6.8

p03114_A,03114,A,indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now,1,84.21,71.05,21.05,13.16,5.26,0,0,7.89,0,7.89,5.26,15.79,13.16,7.89,7.89,0,2.63
p03115_A,03115,A,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man,1,73.03,64.04,22.47,13.48,7.87,0,0,5.62,0,8.99,4.49,14.61,7.87,11.24,5.62,2.25,0
p03116_A,03116,A,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back,1,77.78,61.9,19.05,17.46,7.94,0,0,7.94,1.59,1.59,1.59,14.29,12.7,9.52,4.76,3.17,3.17

p03118_A,03118,A,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character,1,71.43,57.14,24.29,14.29,7.14,0,4.29,2.86,0,10,1.43,8.57,8.57,7.14,2.86,1.43,2.86

p03891_A,03891,A,there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me,1,79.5,68.32,19.25,8.7,6.21,0.62,0,1.86,0,10.56,6.21,14.29,10.56,4.97,8.07,3.73,3.73

p03893_A,03893,A,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me,1,77.03,59.46,20.27,16.22,9.46,1.35,0,5.41,0,4.05,8.11,13.51,8.11,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

p03896_A,03896,A,it is wonderful for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride,1,80.77,69.23,19.23,13.46,1.92,3.85,0,7.69,0,5.77,0,15.38,15.38,7.69,9.62,1.92,3.85
p03897_A,03897,A,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers,1,72.9,57.94,14.02,10.28,0,0,0.93,9.35,0,3.74,6.54,14.95,8.41,4.67,8.41,0.93,1.87

that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too,1,77.44,66.02,19.41,15.06,6.42,0.64,0.57,6.57,0.43,4.35,5.92,15.13,10.14,5.35,7.57,2.28,5.71
p04516_A,04516,A,the first news that reached me of her came in a letter from herself last october it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body and which i believe gave offence to some little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable but had he known it what would it have availed would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address he had left her promising to return he neither returned nor wrote nor relieved her,1,78.24,65.28,21.24,14.51,4.66,0.52,0.52,7.25,0,6.74,5.7,13.47,11.4,2.59,5.7,4.15,4.66

p04747_A,04747,A,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,1,79.4,68.67,16.09,12.02,9.23,0.43,0.43,1.72,0.21,4.08,6.44,16.31,10.73,6.65,7.3,2.79,5.15

yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it

p04541_B,04541,B,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too,1,77.44,66.02,19.41,15.06,6.42,0.64,0.57,6.57,0.43,4.35,5.92,15.13,10.14,5.35,7.57,2.28,5.71
