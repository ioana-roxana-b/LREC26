John Dashwood,Fanny,0,1,it was my father s last request to me that i should assist his widow and daughters,he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,1,2,he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child,he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,2,3,he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home,well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,3,4,well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy,why to be sure that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate

Fanny,John Dashwood,5,6,to be sure it would,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,6,7,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes,oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,7,8,oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,8,9,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more,there is no knowing what they may expect but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,9,10,there is no knowing what they may expect but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do,certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,10,11,certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,11,12,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,12,13,that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable,to be sure it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,13,14,to be sure it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,14,15,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,15,16,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,16,17,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,17,18,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,18,19,i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,19,20,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something,upon my word i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,20,21,upon my word i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
Fanny,John Dashwood,21,22,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it,that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate
John Dashwood,Fanny,22,23,that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here,yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor

Marianne,Mrs. Dashwood,32,33,perhaps i may consider it with some surprise edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly but yet he is not the kind of young man there is something wanting his figure is not striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence and besides all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur to satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless how tame was edward s manner in reading to us last night i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it i could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference,he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time but you would give him cowper,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate
Mrs. Dashwood,Marianne,33,34,he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time but you would give him cowper,nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowper but we must allow for difference of taste elinor has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him but it would have broke my heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require so much he must have all edward s virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm,Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major

Elinor,Marianne,39,40,i am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly of his sense and his goodness no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne,i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart,Marianne,F,major,F,major

Edward Ferrars,Mrs. Dashwood,45,46,devonshire are you indeed going there so far from hence and to what part of it,it is but a cottage but i hope to see many of my friends in it a room or two can easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find none in accommodating them,Fanny; John Dashwood; Mrs. Dashwood,M,intermediate,F,intermediate
Mrs. Dashwood,Marianne,48,49,as for the house itself to be sure it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly,but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him,Elinor; Margaret; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,49,50,but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major
Elinor,Marianne,50,51,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs,did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Mrs. Dashwood,51,52,did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate
Mrs. Dashwood,Marianne,52,53,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty,mama you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has nothing to do with matrimony,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major

regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange

Elinor,Mrs. Jennings,701,702,what is fanny ill,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,intermediate

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,872,873,i know it is or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men,his character however does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major
Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,873,874,his character however does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope,oh my love i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself marianne might at that moment be dying but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend not an application to a parent yet after a time i did say for at first i was quite overcome that if she lived as i trusted she might my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage and since our arrival since our delightful security i have repeated it to him more fully have given him every encouragement in my power time a very little time i tell him will do everything marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby his own merits must soon secure it,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate

Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,875,876,to judge from the colonel s spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate

Edward Ferrars,Elinor,921,922,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Elinor,Edward Ferrars,922,923,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,923,924,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Elinor,Edward Ferrars,924,925,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself which at present after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,926,927,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,Elinor; Marianne,M,intermediate,F,major
Elinor,Marianne,927,928,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit,Edward Ferrars; Marianne,F,major,F,major
