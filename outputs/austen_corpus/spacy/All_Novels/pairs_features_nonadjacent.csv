Mr Shepherd,Mrs Clay,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,11,6,1,1,20,15,1,1,20,9,1,1,12,8,1,1,8,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,27,15,1,1,26,12,1,1,1,1,1,1,240,113,6,8,Anne Elliot; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,M,minor,F,minor

Sir Walter Elliot,Anne Elliot,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow,8,4,1,1,14,3,1,1,6,1,1,1,4,5,1,1,6,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,17,4,1,1,17,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,133,47,9,11,Anne Elliot; Mr Shepherd; Mrs Clay,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Bingley,Elizabeth,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself,4,0,1,0,4,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,5,3,1,1,4,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,6,1,1,7,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,60,29,246,248,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,intermediate,F,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Bingley,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do,10,5,1,1,7,6,1,1,8,8,1,1,8,3,1,1,5,5,1,1,1,4,1,1,11,12,1,1,21,10,1,1,1,1,1,1,121,94,255,257,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,intermediate

Lucy Steele,Elinor,edward s love for me has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived,but what are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth,9,6,1,1,22,4,1,1,16,5,1,1,16,1,1,1,9,5,1,1,4,0,1,0,25,6,1,1,25,11,1,1,0,0,0,0,188,65,451,453,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

John Middleton,Marianne,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle,4,3,1,1,7,12,1,1,6,4,1,1,2,5,1,1,6,6,1,1,3,2,1,1,10,17,1,1,7,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,68,85,475,477,Elinor; Marianne; Mrs. Jennings,M,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Jennings,Elinor,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement,38,0,1,0,66,1,1,1,66,1,1,1,56,1,1,1,72,4,1,1,7,0,1,0,119,5,1,1,86,3,1,1,2,0,1,0,806,24,702,704,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy,14,0,1,0,33,4,1,1,25,1,1,1,43,0,1,0,32,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,49,3,1,1,35,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,344,13,876,878,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Elinor,Edward Ferrars,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,3,1,1,1,13,7,1,1,16,5,1,1,9,1,1,1,15,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,18,10,1,1,7,7,1,1,4,0,1,0,112,64,924,926,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself which at present after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,5,4,1,1,16,9,1,1,16,6,1,1,9,7,1,1,6,2,1,1,3,0,1,0,29,9,1,1,18,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,146,67,925,927,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Edward Ferrars,Marianne,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit,1,1,1,1,7,3,1,1,5,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,10,3,1,1,7,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,64,25,926,928,Elinor; Marianne,M,intermediate,F,major
