p00011_A,00011,A,of course i mean an english church lilia promised me that she would always be in a large town on sundays
p00012_A,00012,A,if she goes to a service at santa deodata s she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the back kitchens of europe

p00020_A,00020,A,oh look the poor wee fish
p00021_A,00021,A,but may not the fish die they have no air

p00024_A,00024,A,i should like to see you now please in my room as i have come all the way on business
p00025_A,00025,A,yes and i forbid you to do it you despise me perhaps and think i m feeble but you re mistaken you are ungrateful and impertinent and contemptible but i will save you in order to save irma and our name there is going to be such a row in this town that you and he ll be sorry you came to it i shall shrink from nothing for my blood is up it is unwise of you to laugh i forbid you to marry carella and i shall tell him so now
p00026_A,00026,A,do
p00027_A,00027,A,tell him so now have it out with him gino gino come in avanti fra filippo forbids the banns fra filippo s blood s up he shrinks from nothing oh take care he doesn t hurt you
p00028_A,00028,A,look what i am giving up to live with you silly fellow no i mean the life those herritons are very well connected they lead sawston society but what do i care so long as i have my silly fellow
p00029_A,00029,A,but you would be right they are not for you many of them are in trade and even we are little more you should have gentlefolk and nobility for your friends
p00030_A,00030,A,oh i forgot your horrid celibacy in england they would be the centre of everything but why shouldn t i know them would it make it easier if i called all round isn t that your foreign way but i must know some one who were the men you were talking to this afternoon but gino dear if they re low class why did you talk to them don t you care about your position
p00031_A,00031,A,very well very well
p00032_A,00032,A,certainly not you are in my country
p00033_A,00033,A,do you like music
p00034_A,00034,A,you are very wise very wise indeed the more precious a possession the more carefully it should be guarded
p00035_A,00035,A,i am your husband
p00036_A,00036,A,you laugh
p00037_A,00037,A,what courage you have and what good fortune he is angry no longer he has forgiven you
p00038_A,00038,A,are we to go into mourning do you think
p00039_A,00039,A,after all she has suffered that letter kept me awake for nights the whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right but if we have mourning it will mean telling irma
p00040_A,00040,A,on irma why
p00041_A,00041,A,on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them
p00042_A,00042,A,there s no need to twist the thing round to that
p00043_A,00043,A,she did but she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy she saw that i was reticent and she did not press me you see philip i can say to you what i could not say before harriet her ideas are so crude really we do not want it known in sawston that there is a baby all peace and comfort would be lost if people came inquiring after it
p00044_A,00044,A,aunt harriet uncle phil grandmamma what do you suppose my little brother is doing now has he begun to play do italian babies talk sooner than us or would he be an english baby born abroad oh i do long to see him and be the first to teach him the ten commandments and the catechism
p00045_A,00045,A,i got up without saying anything
p00046_A,00046,A,i will thank you not to scoff against religion think of that poor baby irma is right to pray for him what an entrance into life for an english child
p00047_A,00047,A,my dear sister i can reassure you firstly the beastly baby is italian secondly it was promptly christened at santa deodata s and a powerful combination of saints watch over
p00048_A,00048,A,don t dear and harriet don t be so serious i mean not so serious when you are with irma she will be worse than ever if she thinks we have something to hide
p00049_A,00049,A,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment
p00050_A,00050,A,as far as i know no steps mrs theobald may have decided on something but i have not heard of it
p00051_A,00051,A,i was meaning had you decided on anything
p00052_A,00052,A,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere
p00053_A,00053,A,i sometimes have given her advice in the past i should not presume to do so now
p00054_A,00054,A,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest
p00055_A,00055,A,my dear how you throw about your money we would never allow it
p00056_A,00056,A,and if she decides on nothing please also let me know let me know in any case
p00057_A,00057,A,you talk like harriet
p00058_A,00058,A,very fine of mrs herriton very fine indeed i m afraid it will mean a lot of expense she will get nothing out of italy without paying
p00059_A,00059,A,harriet harriet shall go too harriet now will be invaluable
p00060_A,00060,A,la prego piano piano c e un altra signorina che dorme
p00061_A,00061,A,you caroline here of all people
p00062_A,00062,A,where does signor carella live

p00069_A,00069,A,when will he be back i shall have to leave a message
p00070_A,00070,A,now perfetta has gone for her basket when she returns she will lower it so then you will put your card into it then she will raise it thus by this means
p00071_A,00071,A,beautiful as an angel but who am i addressing
p00072_A,00072,A,my dear sister you can t run on like that you don t buy a pair of gloves in two hours much less a baby
p00073_A,00073,A,but harriet what if at first he was to refuse
p00074_A,00074,A,no harriet i ll try for the baby but for nothing else i promise to do that tomorrow and to do it in the way you wish but tonight as we re all tired we want a change of topic we want relaxation we want to go to the theatre
p00075_A,00075,A,theatres here and at such a moment
p00076_A,00076,A,we should hardly enjoy it with the great interview impending
p00077_A,00077,A,certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music it is sure to be very bad but it might be better than sitting idle all the evening we have no book and i lost my crochet at florence
p00078_A,00078,A,good miss abbott you are coming too
p00079_A,00079,A,good gracious me i should never have thought of that as likely as not we should have tried to save money and sat among the most awful people one keeps on forgetting this is italy
p00080_A,00080,A,don t you like it at all
p00081_A,00081,A,most awfully
p00082_A,00082,A,shut it
p00083_A,00083,A,it is tiresome but perhaps it isn t for us to interfere

p00090_A,00090,A,it is an english marriage i do not care about the money i am having her for my son did you not understand that
p00091_A,00091,A,no it is not necessary signor carella since you are tired of the baby
p00092_A,00092,A,how
p00093_A,00093,A,they would separate our thoughts
p00094_A,00094,A,hullo

p00096_A,00096,A,what is it

p00107_A,00107,A,he has visions of the saints
p00108_A,00108,A,she has gone for a walk she has gone for a walk perhaps to wish good bye to her little nephew preferring to come back another way she has sent you this note by the poor idiot and is waiting for you outside the siena gate many of my guests do this
p00109_A,00109,A,hush sleeping

p00005_B,00005,B,i wish that mrs charles had gotten the footwarmer these london porters won t take heed to a country chap
p00006_B,00006,B,but you did your best and i think it simply noble of you to have brought mrs theobald all the way here on such a day as this
p00007_B,00007,B,and granny when will the old ship get to italy
p00008_B,00008,B,here beginneth the new life
p00009_B,00009,B,poor child how vulgar it s surprising that she isn t worse but she has got a look of poor charles about her
p00010_B,00010,B,i cannot understand people what can they be doing all day and there is no church there i suppose
p00011_B,00011,B,now dears don t listen to lilia s letter we love this place and i do not know how i shall ever thank philip for telling me it it is not only so quaint but one sees the italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here the frescoes are wonderful caroline who grows sweeter every day is very busy sketching
p00012_B,00012,B,every one to his taste

p00016_B,00016,B,no answer get down mr philip s gladstone from the attic
p00017_B,00017,B,i ve told nothing it s all for you and if it only takes a quarter of an hour you ll be lucky
p00018_B,00018,B,oh look the poor wee fish
p00019_B,00019,B,but may not the fish die they have no air
p00020_B,00020,B,fish live on water not on air
p00021_B,00021,B,well philip i am sure you are ready for by bye we shall meet at twelve o clock lunch tomorrow if we don t meet before they give us caffe later in our rooms
p00022_B,00022,B,i should like to see you now please in my room as i have come all the way on business
p00023_B,00023,B,my dear lilia don t let s have a scene before i arrived i thought i might have to question you it is unnecessary i know everything miss abbott has told me a certain amount and the rest i see for myself
p00024_B,00024,B,see for yourself
p00025_B,00025,B,tell him so now have it out with him gino gino come in avanti fra filippo forbids the banns fra filippo s blood s up he shrinks from nothing oh take care he doesn t hurt you
p00026_B,00026,B,please sit down signor carella mrs herriton is rather agitated but there is no reason we should not be calm might i offer you a cigarette please sit down signor carella i will be frank with you i have come to prevent you marrying mrs herriton because i see you will both be unhappy together she is english you are italian she is accustomed to one thing you to another and pardon me if i say it she is rich and you are poor
p00027_B,00027,B,i am not marrying her because she is rich
p00028_B,00028,B,the air is good so is the food she will be happy here and we shall not have to part with the money
p00029_B,00029,B,but besides your relatives i must have other people here your friends have wives and sisters haven t they
p00030_B,00030,B,you must not go out alone it is not safe if you want to walk perfetta shall accompany you
p00031_B,00031,B,immensely rich
p00032_B,00032,B,passionately i have not studied scientific music but the music of the heart yes
p00033_B,00033,B,i think you are quite right i shall not bring people to the house any more i do not see why an english wife should be treated differently this is italy
p00034_B,00034,B,this is italy
p00035_B,00035,B,none of his clothes seemed to fit too big in one place too small in another what has happened he is ill ill
p00036_B,00036,B,what courage you have and what good fortune he is angry no longer he has forgiven you
p00037_B,00037,B,it s nothing
p00038_B,00038,B,of course we must tell irma
p00039_B,00039,B,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage
p00040_B,00040,B,there s no need to twist the thing round to that
p00041_B,00041,B,of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours
p00042_B,00042,B,it will make a difference in the money surely
p00043_B,00043,B,never mind it s all over now let the dead bury their dead it s fallen out of our lives
p00044_B,00044,B,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks
p00045_B,00045,B,he is the devil
p00046_B,00046,B,don t dear and harriet don t be so serious i mean not so serious when you are with irma she will be worse than ever if she thinks we have something to hide
p00047_B,00047,B,i cannot think what his motive is in sending them
p00048_B,00048,B,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up
p00049_B,00049,B,yes it is all very sad my daughter in law made a very unhappy marriage as i dare say you know i suppose that the child will be educated in italy possibly his grandmother may be doing something but i have not heard of it i do not expect that she will have him over she disapproves of the father it is altogether a painful business for her
p00050_B,00050,B,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere
p00051_B,00051,B,poor lilia was almost a daughter to me once i know what miss abbott means but now things have altered any initiative would naturally come from mrs theobald
p00052_B,00052,B,but does not mrs theobald always take any initiative from you
p00053_B,00053,B,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest
p00054_B,00054,B,my dear caroline you must not brood over the thing let bygones be bygones the child should worry you even less than it worries us we never even mention it it belongs to another world
p00055_B,00055,B,is the young person mad never in my life have i seen such colossal impertinence she ought to be well smacked and sent back to sunday school but don t you see she is practically threatening us you can t put her off with mrs theobald she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity if we don t do anything she s going to raise a scandal that we neglect our relatives c which is of course a lie still she ll say it oh dear sweet sober caroline abbott has a screw loose we knew it at monteriano i had my suspicions last year one day in the train and here it is again the young person is mad shall i go round at once and give it her well i d really enjoy it
p00056_B,00056,B,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities
p00057_B,00057,B,i am planning what can be done and that kind caroline abbott is helping me it is no business of either of us but we are getting to feel that the baby must not be left entirely to that horrible man it would be unfair to little irma after all he is her half brother no we have come to nothing definite
p00058_B,00058,B,it depends
p00059_B,00059,B,did mother explain it all to you
p00060_B,00060,B,you caroline here of all people
p00061_B,00061,B,where does signor carella live
p00062_B,00062,B,she will show you follow her always always and you will come to no harm she is a trustworthy guide she is my daughter cousin sister
p00063_B,00063,B,do you chance to know whether signor carella is in
p00064_B,00064,B,that is perfetta
p00065_B,00065,B,out
p00066_B,00066,B,why on earth did you say he was in
p00067_B,00067,B,when will he be back i shall have to leave a message
p00068_B,00068,B,now perfetta has gone for her basket when she returns she will lower it so then you will put your card into it then she will raise it thus by this means
p00069_B,00069,B,beautiful as an angel but who am i addressing
p00070_B,00070,B,thank you here is my card has a young lady happened to call here lately a young english lady a young lady pale large tall a young lady
p00071_B,00071,B,perfetta is deaf when she chooses
p00072_B,00072,B,but harriet what if at first he was to refuse
p00073_B,00073,B,i dare say it will be all right but as i told you i thought the man i met on the rocca a strange difficult man
p00074_B,00074,B,we should hardly enjoy it with the great interview impending
p00075_B,00075,B,don t you think it s better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous
p00076_B,00076,B,mother wouldn t like it it would be most unsuitable almost irreverent besides all that foreign theatres are notorious don t you remember those letters in the church family newspaper
p00077_B,00077,B,it is very kind of you mr herriton in some ways i should enjoy it but excuse the suggestion i don t think we ought to go to cheap seats
p00078_B,00078,B,good gracious me i should never have thought of that as likely as not we should have tried to save money and sat among the most awful people one keeps on forgetting this is italy
p00079_B,00079,B,oh that ll be all right we ll go as we are and buy the best we can get monteriano is not formal we do all right
p00080_B,00080,B,shish
p00081_B,00081,B,shut it
p00082_B,00082,B,it is tiresome but perhaps it isn t for us to interfere
p00083_B,00083,B,why it is the famous hot lady of the apennines the one who had never never before
p00084_B,00084,B,no no you don t escape me now
p00085_B,00085,B,i left a message
p00086_B,00086,B,certainly
p00087_B,00087,B,yes rather
p00088_B,00088,B,harriet and her brother don t realize what is before them she would bluster and be rude he would be pleasant and take it as a joke both of them even if they offered money would fail but i begin to understand the man s nature he does not love the child but he will be touchy about it and that is quite as bad for us he s charming but he s no fool he conquered me last year he conquered mr herriton yesterday and if i am not careful he will conquer us all today and the baby will grow up in monteriano he is terribly strong lilia found that out but only i remember it now
p00089_B,00089,B,mr herriton called yesterday but you were out
p00090_B,00090,B,i don t mean that
p00091_B,00091,B,i know ah in a foreign language and how perfectly you speak italian one is certain to make slips you meant that we could not always be together yet he and i you are right what is to be done i cannot afford a nurse and perfetta is too rough when he was ill i dare not let her touch him when he has to be washed which happens now and then who does it i i feed him or settle what he shall have i sleep with him and comfort him when he is unhappy in the night no one talks no one may sing to him but i do not be unfair this time i like to do these things but nevertheless his voice became pathetic they take up a great deal of time and are not all suitable for a young man
p00092_B,00092,B,wake up
p00093_B,00093,B,oh take care
