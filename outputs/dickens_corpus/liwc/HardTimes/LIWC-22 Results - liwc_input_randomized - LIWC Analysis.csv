p00168_A,00168,A,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration,1,79.82,59.63,25.69,16.51,4.59,0,6.42,5.5,0,9.17,0.92,11.01,11.01,5.5,7.34,0,3.67

p00172_A,00172,A,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced,1,76.85,63.89,17.59,12.96,3.7,0.93,4.63,3.7,0,4.63,6.48,12.96,10.19,7.41,7.41,2.78,1.85
p00173_A,00173,A,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears,1,78.18,61.09,12.73,6.18,1.82,1.09,2.91,0,0.36,6.55,7.27,16.73,8.36,5.82,7.27,1.82,8.73
p00174_A,00174,A,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that,1,77.36,62.26,24.53,18.87,7.55,0,5.66,5.66,0,5.66,3.77,11.32,16.98,0,3.77,3.77,1.89
