Alexis Ivanovitch,Marqis De Griers,8,10,just so you must know that on one occasion when for two days i had felt certain that at any moment i might have to depart for rome on business i repaired to the embassy of the holy see in paris to have my passport visaed there i encountered a sacristan of about fifty and a man dry and cold of mien after listening politely but with great reserve to my account of myself this sacristan asked me to wait a little i was in a great hurry to depart but of course i sat down pulled out a copy of l opinion nationale and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against russia which it happened to contain as i was thus engaged i heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for monsignor after which i saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor and then another bow as the visitor took his leave i ventured to remind the good man of my own business also whereupon with an expression of if anything increased dryness he again asked me to wait soon a third visitor arrived who like myself had come on business he was an austrian of some sort and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs this made me very angry i rose approached the sacristan and told him that since monsignor was receiving callers his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment it simply passed his understanding that any insignificant russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of monsignor s in a tone of the utmost effrontery as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me he looked me up and down and then said but i only cried the louder screeched the sacristan again shrinking back in horror then rushing to the door he spread out his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter,what really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and a barbarian cela n tait pas si b te,Marqis De Griers; Mr. Astley; The General,M,major,M,intermediate

Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,69,71,to the german method of heaping up riches i have not been here very long but i can tell you that what i have seen and verified makes my tartar blood boil good lord i wish for no virtues of that kind yesterday i went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere i found that things were even as we read of them in good german picture books that every house has its vater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable so honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and i cannot bear people of that sort each such vater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching do not be angry general let me tell you something that is even more touching than that i can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother yes i know how things ought to be done yet every german family is bound to slavery and to submission to its vater they work like oxen and amass wealth like jews suppose the vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded for the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital yes such things are done for i have been making inquiries on the subject it is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been rightly sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge what more have i to tell well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son perhaps he has his gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden so the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated then the vater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies in turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous vater and the old story begins again in fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original vater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to his son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a baron rothschild or a hoppe and company or the devil knows what is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all what is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves yes there you have it in a nutshell for my own part i would rather grow fat after the russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette i have no wish to be hoppe and company at the end of five generations i want the money for myself for in no way do i look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital i may be wrong but there you have it those are my views,because he is a brute,Marqis De Griers; Polina Alexandrovna; The General,M,major,F,major
