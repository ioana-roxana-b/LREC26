p00934_B,00934,B,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs,1,72.09,59.69,16.28,7.75,5.43,0.78,0.78,0.78,0,8.53,8.53,11.63,10.85,5.43,6.98,2.33,3.1

p00936_B,00936,B,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both,1,77.48,69.37,19.82,12.61,0.9,3.6,0.9,3.6,3.6,7.21,8.11,8.11,14.41,3.6,7.21,7.21,3.6
