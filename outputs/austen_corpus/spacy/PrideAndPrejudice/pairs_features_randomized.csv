Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts while mary is adjusting her ideas let us return to mr bingley,my dear mr bennet how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them,4,0,1,0,7,4,1,1,4,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,9,6,1,1,8,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,68,23,40,8,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish,oh my dear i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it,1,2,1,1,4,11,1,1,3,4,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,2,1,1,8,10,1,1,3,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,41,63,128,302,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,well my dear if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders,she is so fond of mrs forster it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment,2,2,1,1,5,5,1,1,4,2,1,1,0,7,0,1,3,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,6,4,1,1,4,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,37,41,144,906,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,i hope my dear that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party,of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy,2,0,1,0,1,2,1,1,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,0,1,5,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,25,25,297,448,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger,no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him,3,0,1,0,1,4,1,1,1,5,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,11,1,1,1,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,12,46,299,304,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,it is not mr bingley it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases,impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing,4,0,1,0,5,3,1,1,4,2,1,1,7,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,14,4,1,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,74,18,301,37,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,it certainly is a most iniquitous affair and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself,why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week,3,6,1,1,5,6,1,1,3,8,1,1,3,3,1,1,5,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,7,1,1,5,13,1,1,1,0,1,0,40,79,303,2,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again,mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves,2,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,7,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,8,6,1,1,3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,72,27,305,20,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet,i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else,1,4,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,3,1,1,4,4,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,5,5,1,1,1,6,1,1,0,1,0,1,21,52,454,497,Elizabeth; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do,what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him,2,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,1,3,1,1,3,0,1,0,9,5,1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,44,20,456,457,Elizabeth; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor,my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals,1,6,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,9,1,1,0,8,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,3,1,1,5,18,1,1,2,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,26,105,492,129,Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major

Jane,Elizabeth,i must think your language too strong in speaking of both and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does,you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend,1,7,1,1,10,27,1,1,7,18,1,1,9,15,1,1,9,26,1,1,4,5,1,1,22,42,1,1,8,26,1,1,2,0,1,0,113,240,503,473,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him,1,0,1,0,4,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,2,6,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,8,1,1,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,28,31,505,699,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,and do you impute it to either of those,you must decide for yourself and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him,0,2,0,1,1,3,1,1,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,8,1,1,2,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,40,507,477,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him,my dear jane you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve nay this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable,0,6,0,1,0,17,0,1,0,12,0,1,1,8,1,1,2,6,1,1,0,6,0,1,3,31,1,1,1,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,185,509,500,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Jane,Elizabeth,his being so sure of succeeding was wrong and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment,i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks,0,1,0,1,5,4,1,1,3,5,1,1,2,4,1,1,3,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,7,1,1,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,24,53,698,371,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Jane,Elizabeth,you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate,i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business,1,1,1,1,5,6,1,1,1,4,1,1,4,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,7,1,1,1,2,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,38,51,716,506,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,not yet but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well,i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before,0,4,0,1,3,6,1,1,2,5,1,1,3,3,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,2,1,1,2,9,1,1,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,17,69,821,418,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Jane,Elizabeth,we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them,1,3,1,1,3,11,1,1,5,8,1,1,4,3,1,1,8,2,1,1,1,3,1,1,11,8,1,1,3,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,51,71,825,467,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Jane,Elizabeth,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody,1,2,1,1,6,6,1,1,5,2,1,1,5,5,1,1,11,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,13,4,1,1,8,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,73,42,834,369,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before,and this is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end,0,2,0,1,6,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,0,2,0,1,7,3,1,1,3,0,1,0,9,2,1,1,6,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,47,26,836,998,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself,7,0,1,0,9,3,1,1,7,2,1,1,6,0,1,0,10,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,16,3,1,1,13,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,104,24,838,835,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Jane,Elizabeth,i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false,that is the most unforgiving speech that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard,0,2,0,1,8,2,1,1,7,0,1,0,4,4,1,1,8,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,5,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,49,31,842,1007,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Jane,Elizabeth,perhaps it would have been better but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it,2,6,1,1,4,18,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,9,1,1,1,14,1,1,0,5,0,1,3,20,1,1,3,18,1,1,0,2,0,1,30,140,844,715,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Elizabeth,Jane,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks,3,7,1,1,6,9,1,1,3,7,1,1,2,6,1,1,0,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,6,16,1,1,5,13,1,1,0,1,0,1,51,104,713,838,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate
Elizabeth,Jane,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds,6,1,1,1,18,7,1,1,6,8,1,1,9,1,1,1,14,9,1,1,5,3,1,1,20,12,1,1,18,4,1,1,2,1,1,1,140,65,715,893,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain,5,0,1,0,7,5,1,1,6,2,1,1,8,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,17,3,1,1,12,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,106,26,597,386,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now,4,2,1,1,10,10,1,1,5,6,1,1,6,9,1,1,7,14,1,1,1,3,1,1,14,22,1,1,10,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,88,105,600,1105,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses,4,0,1,0,8,2,1,1,5,0,1,0,4,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,6,0,1,0,10,6,1,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,76,19,607,1091,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,2,0,1,0,4,4,1,1,6,1,1,1,6,0,1,0,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,10,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,53,12,610,795,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun,7,6,1,1,7,4,1,1,5,5,1,1,7,2,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,5,1,1,9,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,69,37,614,1133,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly,1,1,1,1,3,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,20,33,616,384,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever,5,3,1,1,7,9,1,1,5,4,1,1,8,9,1,1,9,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,13,16,1,1,6,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,76,90,618,291,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,3,5,1,1,5,6,1,1,0,3,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,2,1,1,4,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,27,41,622,284,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,8,0,1,0,9,2,1,1,9,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,6,2,1,1,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,92,12,624,793,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule,5,2,1,1,19,3,1,1,6,1,1,1,11,2,1,1,7,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,19,2,1,1,9,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,115,29,658,286,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic,13,2,1,1,18,1,1,1,14,1,1,1,9,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,31,1,1,1,22,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,191,14,660,99,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast,1,2,1,1,8,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,5,4,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,11,1,1,1,8,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,71,21,662,243,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,1,2,1,1,3,6,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,15,39,664,659,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society,3,4,1,1,9,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,9,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,14,1,1,1,9,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,71,26,666,211,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,12,2,1,1,15,2,1,1,8,0,1,0,3,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,27,3,1,1,20,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,155,23,668,623,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,2,1,1,1,3,5,1,1,4,5,1,1,2,5,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,7,1,1,5,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,35,42,1080,613,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it,will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties,0,3,0,1,4,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,3,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,5,2,1,1,1,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,28,39,1084,256,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton,2,2,1,1,4,6,1,1,4,3,1,1,5,6,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,7,12,1,1,2,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,42,64,1086,778,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,7,1,1,1,7,2,1,1,5,4,1,1,7,2,1,1,5,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,9,5,1,1,6,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,75,27,1088,1087,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,had you then persuaded yourself that i should,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,0,2,0,1,2,15,1,1,1,10,1,1,1,12,1,1,0,6,0,1,0,1,0,1,3,32,1,1,0,14,0,1,0,1,0,1,8,140,1090,1077,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,0,3,0,1,0,9,0,1,1,7,1,1,0,6,0,1,2,10,1,1,0,1,0,1,4,23,1,1,2,10,1,1,0,0,0,0,12,97,1104,1101,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,2,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,4,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,5,5,1,1,3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,28,42,1132,615,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,may i ask to what these questions tend,1,0,1,0,3,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,11,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,48,8,1134,401,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,5,6,1,1,14,18,1,1,11,6,1,1,18,8,1,1,7,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,28,24,1,1,16,21,1,1,1,0,1,0,145,151,1136,667,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,2,1,1,1,9,4,1,1,12,1,1,1,12,2,1,1,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,19,4,1,1,14,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,107,21,1138,603,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,4,2,1,1,15,6,1,1,11,3,1,1,6,0,1,0,2,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,17,9,1,1,10,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,99,45,1144,1079,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,0,2,0,1,2,6,1,1,0,7,0,1,1,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,14,1,1,1,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,15,71,1148,1097,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,2,0,1,0,11,0,1,0,7,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,3,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,13,4,1,1,6,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,76,12,247,1104,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner,4,0,1,0,4,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,12,3,1,1,7,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,68,12,252,1142,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away,1,2,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,16,38,270,222,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming,5,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,1,1,5,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,41,21,284,1094,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible,1,4,1,1,0,6,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,4,1,1,1,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,10,47,395,381,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,and what is your success,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,0,8,0,1,1,9,1,1,1,9,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,5,0,1,1,6,1,1,0,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,92,403,624,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you,2,2,1,1,5,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,5,1,1,1,4,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,46,15,405,253,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening,1,0,1,0,5,6,1,1,4,3,1,1,4,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,3,2,1,1,9,9,1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,51,36,596,1092,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,2,12,1,1,0,15,0,1,0,8,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,27,1,1,4,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,19,155,601,668,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done,but i was embarrassed,1,0,1,0,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,39,4,606,1140,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,perfectly so i thank you,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them,0,4,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,5,0,1,2,5,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,2,11,1,1,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,70,611,1076,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,1,6,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,3,1,1,5,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,7,4,1,1,4,8,1,1,0,1,0,1,42,51,613,383,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine,2,1,1,1,3,7,1,1,3,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,1,3,1,1,5,6,1,1,3,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,42,50,615,390,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance,certainly there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without,2,0,1,0,1,6,1,1,1,7,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,2,12,1,1,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,24,53,621,285,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now,2,4,1,1,2,19,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,15,1,1,1,16,1,1,0,2,0,1,3,28,1,1,3,15,1,1,0,2,0,1,23,155,623,792,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,you are severe on us,2,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,39,5,659,100,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,6,1,1,0,1,0,1,10,6,1,1,7,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,37,29,661,248,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,0,1,0,1,2,8,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,5,1,1,2,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,2,11,1,1,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,9,71,665,662,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,that is a failing indeed implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me,6,3,1,1,18,5,1,1,6,1,1,1,8,2,1,1,7,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,24,6,1,1,21,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,151,32,667,292,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,3,1,1,1,8,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,5,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,12,11,1,1,9,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,70,48,669,1134,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,4,5,1,1,8,7,1,1,4,5,1,1,4,8,1,1,1,9,1,1,3,1,1,1,13,13,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,0,1,0,65,76,791,618,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,0,5,0,1,2,7,1,1,1,6,1,1,2,8,1,1,1,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,2,17,1,1,0,12,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,106,793,597,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,0,4,0,1,4,8,1,1,1,5,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,3,1,1,0,6,0,1,1,10,1,1,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,76,795,607,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created,1,0,1,0,10,3,1,1,7,1,1,1,2,6,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,12,7,1,1,10,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,87,33,797,396,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,1,5,1,1,8,19,1,1,1,6,1,1,3,11,1,1,0,7,0,1,1,2,1,1,4,19,1,1,2,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,34,115,1075,658,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders,2,1,1,1,15,3,1,1,10,1,1,1,12,2,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,32,3,1,1,14,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,140,24,1077,602,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles,2,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,2,1,1,2,0,1,0,9,3,1,1,6,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,45,12,1079,620,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,2,1,1,1,11,3,1,1,4,0,1,0,10,0,1,0,3,3,1,1,3,0,1,0,19,2,1,1,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,80,15,1081,664,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,1,10,1,1,6,7,1,1,2,8,1,1,3,8,1,1,2,5,1,1,2,1,1,1,13,11,1,1,3,21,1,1,0,1,0,1,49,121,1083,255,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me,oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long,3,1,1,1,8,4,1,1,2,4,1,1,5,5,1,1,6,2,1,1,0,1,0,1,19,5,1,1,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,75,38,1085,798,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,1,7,1,1,2,7,1,1,4,5,1,1,2,7,1,1,2,5,1,1,0,1,0,1,5,9,1,1,2,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,27,75,1087,1088,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,11,4,1,1,28,15,1,1,16,11,1,1,14,6,1,1,2,2,1,1,8,3,1,1,36,17,1,1,29,10,1,1,0,0,0,0,252,99,1089,1144,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it,0,13,0,1,0,18,0,1,1,14,1,1,1,9,1,1,1,3,1,1,0,5,0,1,1,31,1,1,0,22,0,1,1,0,1,0,7,191,1095,660,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else,2,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,7,0,1,0,5,2,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,14,2,1,1,5,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,71,19,1097,394,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever,3,0,1,0,9,1,1,1,7,2,1,1,6,3,1,1,10,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,23,2,1,1,10,2,1,1,0,1,0,1,97,18,1101,212,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,2,2,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,3,5,1,1,3,2,1,1,0,2,0,1,6,7,1,1,3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,26,42,1103,1086,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major

Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one,24,2,1,1,58,4,1,1,45,3,1,1,41,2,1,1,27,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,90,8,1,1,62,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,572,42,432,439,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,i am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them,6,2,1,1,6,5,1,1,6,4,1,1,8,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,13,1,1,6,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,71,54,434,433,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation,4,6,1,1,18,13,1,1,12,7,1,1,8,4,1,1,7,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,34,19,1,1,24,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,171,106,440,435,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,6,4,1,1,13,18,1,1,7,12,1,1,4,8,1,1,2,7,1,1,2,2,1,1,19,34,1,1,7,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,106,171,435,440,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate

Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one,were it certain that lady catherine would think so but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications,2,2,1,1,4,7,1,1,3,7,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,9,1,1,5,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,42,53,439,436,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate
Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart,you are uniformly charming and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable,6,1,1,1,8,4,1,1,4,3,1,1,5,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,16,4,1,1,10,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,92,28,441,442,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate
Mrs. Bennet,Mrs. Gardiner,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent,5,4,1,1,21,4,1,1,10,5,1,1,16,7,1,1,19,5,1,1,2,0,1,0,26,6,1,1,14,6,1,1,1,0,1,0,165,62,517,518,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,intermediate
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent,well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it,4,0,1,0,4,6,1,1,5,2,1,1,7,2,1,1,5,2,1,1,0,2,0,1,6,7,1,1,6,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,62,33,518,529,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley s love,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating,2,2,1,1,3,12,1,1,3,11,1,1,8,6,1,1,3,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,10,1,1,6,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,50,76,520,814,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything i hope that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her,i do indeed i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her,2,5,1,1,18,8,1,1,8,10,1,1,14,2,1,1,15,11,1,1,1,2,1,1,25,19,1,1,19,13,1,1,1,0,1,0,139,111,522,816,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father,and of this place i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them,5,1,1,1,17,16,1,1,9,5,1,1,9,4,1,1,9,3,1,1,5,2,1,1,29,12,1,1,9,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,134,70,526,747,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary,0,4,0,1,1,7,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,8,1,1,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,11,63,528,541,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,elizabeth you are not serious now,as i did the other day very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied,0,2,0,1,1,10,1,1,0,8,0,1,1,9,1,1,0,7,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,15,1,1,0,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,83,530,533,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him,a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we,0,1,0,1,3,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,7,0,1,0,3,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,6,3,1,1,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,26,28,532,547,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,this fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before,0,5,0,1,1,5,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,3,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,6,1,1,3,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,16,56,770,519,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,that is not very likely our authority was too good,i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love,0,3,0,1,2,5,1,1,0,4,0,1,2,5,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,11,1,1,0,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,10,72,772,521,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major

Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Elizabeth,aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure said she are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet,one of them does,7,0,1,0,18,0,1,0,11,0,1,0,10,0,1,0,12,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,20,1,1,1,12,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,152,4,580,569,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Maria; Miss De Bourgh; Mrs. Jenkinson,F,intermediate,F,major

Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Elizabeth,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age,yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind,0,7,0,1,4,12,1,1,0,8,0,1,1,7,1,1,0,3,0,1,2,4,1,1,4,8,1,1,1,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,17,95,586,583,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Maria; Miss De Bourgh; Mrs. Jenkinson,F,intermediate,F,major
Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Elizabeth,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house,and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject,2,4,1,1,11,17,1,1,9,7,1,1,11,13,1,1,11,10,1,1,3,3,1,1,15,28,1,1,10,13,1,1,1,1,1,1,113,151,594,1054,Charlotte Lucas; Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,F,intermediate,F,major
Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Elizabeth,miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn,but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit,4,0,1,0,7,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,5,3,1,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,52,20,609,1036,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,F,intermediate,F,major

Colonel Fitzwilliam,Elizabeth,you are rather disposed to call his interference officious,i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case,0,3,0,1,1,7,1,1,0,7,0,1,1,2,1,1,1,7,1,1,0,3,0,1,2,8,1,1,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,9,70,653,654,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,7,8,1,1,13,19,1,1,9,17,1,1,10,10,1,1,7,18,1,1,2,3,1,1,13,18,1,1,9,18,1,1,0,2,0,1,112,173,803,812,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major
Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,do you really think so,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,16,5,807,804,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major
Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,1,4,1,1,9,3,1,1,4,3,1,1,9,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,6,2,1,1,8,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,56,29,809,808,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major
Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,0,8,0,1,2,17,1,1,4,12,1,1,1,10,1,1,2,22,1,1,0,5,0,1,3,24,1,1,5,24,1,1,0,1,0,1,29,197,811,810,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major
Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,3,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,43,16,806,807,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor

Mrs. Bennet,Mr. Gardiner,if i had been able to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now here s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done,5,4,1,1,22,11,1,1,17,10,1,1,10,7,1,1,13,4,1,1,4,4,1,1,28,15,1,1,12,12,1,1,1,0,1,0,166,110,829,830,Elizabeth; Jane; Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor
Mr. Gardiner,Mrs. Bennet,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done,oh my dear brother that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all,4,2,1,1,11,16,1,1,10,19,1,1,7,6,1,1,4,9,1,1,4,4,1,1,15,29,1,1,12,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,110,171,830,831,Elizabeth; Mrs. Bennet; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major
Mary,Elizabeth,this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever,8,1,1,1,12,4,1,1,10,3,1,1,5,4,1,1,8,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,8,7,1,1,13,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,99,44,832,833,Elizabeth,F,minor,F,major
