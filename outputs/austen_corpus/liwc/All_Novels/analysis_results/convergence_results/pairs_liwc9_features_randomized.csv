00097,Mr. Knightley,Emma,177,646,i have reason to think that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her,this present from the campbells this pianoforte is very kindly given,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
00098,Mr. Knightley,Emma,179,174,well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch,indeed how so of what sort,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
00099,Mr. Knightley,Emma,181,168,certainly i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you,thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may you do not often overpower me with it,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00100,Mr. Knightley,Emma,183,17,then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about,especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00101,Mr. Knightley,Emma,185,184,nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken,oh to be sure it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00102,Mr. Knightley,Emma,187,469,you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him,i am happy you approved but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00103,Mr. Knightley,Emma,189,495,not harriet s equal no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
00104,Mr. Knightley,Emma,191,1360,a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer,upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00105,Mr. Knightley,Emma,193,1032,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement,between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00106,Mr. Knightley,Emma,195,1103,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00107,Mr. Knightley,Emma,197,1334,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son,he writes like a sensible man i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00108,Mr. Knightley,Emma,199,439,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece,my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00109,Mr. Knightley,Emma,201,1362,good morning to you,oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00110,Mr. Knightley,Emma,299,1332,if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike,impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00111,Mr. Knightley,Emma,301,417,yes and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born,how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00112,Mr. Knightley,Emma,303,404,yes a good deal nearer,yes do,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00113,Mr. Knightley,Emma,305,1350,i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now,indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
00114,Mr. Knightley,Emma,307,300,a man cannot be more so,to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
00115,Mr. Knightley,Emma,401,176,your father will not be easy why do not you go,very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00116,Mr. Knightley,Emma,403,847,shall i ring the bell,well mrs weston what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00117,Mr. Knightley,Emma,414,302,the churchills are very likely in fault but i dare say he might come if he would,a material difference then and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00118,Mr. Knightley,Emma,416,196,i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00119,Mr. Knightley,Emma,418,425,i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00120,Mr. Knightley,Emma,420,431,it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills,we shall never agree about him but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00121,Mr. Knightley,Emma,422,841,and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure,no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00122,Mr. Knightley,Emma,424,1338,there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going,oh if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00123,Mr. Knightley,Emma,426,843,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his,well and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
00124,Mr. Knightley,Emma,428,200,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,i am very much obliged to you if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00125,Mr. Knightley,Emma,430,1034,our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now,never never never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me and how could it possibly come into your head,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00126,Mr. Knightley,Emma,432,1159,yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
00127,Mr. Knightley,Emma,434,1368,i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him,me ah poor harriet,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
00128,Mr. Knightley,Emma,436,1030,me not at all i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners,oh it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
00129,Mr. Knightley,Emma,438,1277,you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts,she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00130,Mr. Knightley,Emma,440,437,and mine is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point,well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00136,Mr. Knightley,Emma,479,1281,true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax,you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00137,Mr. Knightley,Emma,484,198,emma i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00138,Mr. Knightley,Emma,494,485,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled,news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00139,Mr. Knightley,Emma,586,1330,how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner,i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00140,Mr. Knightley,Emma,645,429,quite out of the question quite out of the question but you must often wish it i am sure,oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00141,Mr. Knightley,Emma,781,441,you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck,i will say no more about him you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00142,Mr. Knightley,Emma,831,21,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her,well you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00143,Mr. Knightley,Emma,834,1259,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness,mr knightley i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00144,Mr. Knightley,Emma,836,782,yes any body may know how highly i think of her,i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more he is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily i must not dwell upon it i must not think of it i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00145,Mr. Knightley,Emma,838,180,oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very sure i shall never ask her,pray mr knightley how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
00146,Mr. Knightley,Emma,840,1271,so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax,and i have not forgotten how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00147,Mr. Knightley,Emma,842,968,no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife,i did and they cannot forgive me,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
00148,Mr. Knightley,Emma,844,186,yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours,i saw her answer nothing could be clearer,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
00149,Mr. Knightley,Emma,846,170,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond,almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00150,Mr. Knightley,Emma,881,190,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing,i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00151,Mr. Knightley,Emma,943,306,no that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure,that s true very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed,Emma; Mr. John Knightley,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00152,Mr. Knightley,Emma,967,1257,they aimed at wounding more than harriet emma why is it that they are your enemies she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet,you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00154,Mr. Knightley,Emma,971,1322,not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it,poor child at that rate what will become of her,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
00155,Mr. Knightley,Emma,976,188,whom are you going to dance with,and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00156,Mr. Knightley,Emma,978,194,will you,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00157,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1029,202,pray emma may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other,why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00158,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1031,178,the joke seemed confined to you and mr churchill my dear emma do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of,he is very obliging but is he sure that harriet means to marry him,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

00161,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1102,944,is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of,upon my word you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Elton; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Weston; Mrs. Elton,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00162,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1132,979,emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible,indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00163,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1134,28,i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00166,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1252,423,if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already,it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00170,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1260,476,i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well,oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00171,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1262,845,he is a most fortunate man so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed,in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00175,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1270,433,he trifles here as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here,your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
00176,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1272,1263,i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think had you not been in the case i should still have distrusted him very bad though it might have been worse playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other,you speak as if you envied him,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00177,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1274,24,the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could i perfectly agree with you sir you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00178,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1276,972,i hope he does smallridge what does this mean what is all this,i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00179,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1278,832,say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00180,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1280,480,well there is feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands come he knows himself there those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it,she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00181,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1282,977,yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject,with you if you will ask me,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00182,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1321,1255,that is she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference,you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but i seem to have been doomed to blindness,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00183,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1323,427,nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00184,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1325,1251,do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least,oh the best nature in the world a wedding,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

00198,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1357,192,it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00199,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1359,1336,you ought to know your friend best but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her,he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00200,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1361,1328,do you dare say this do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve,what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
00201,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1363,1279,i am quite sure that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day,i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

00203,Mr. Knightley,Emma,1367,1354,and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for,you mistake me you quite mistake me it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00205,Emma,Mr. Knightley,26,1282,i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making,yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject,Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00209,Emma,Mr. Knightley,170,424,almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended,there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00211,Emma,Mr. Knightley,174,846,indeed how so of what sort,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00212,Emma,Mr. Knightley,176,438,very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant,you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00213,Emma,Mr. Knightley,178,177,he is very obliging but is he sure that harriet means to marry him,i have reason to think that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00214,Emma,Mr. Knightley,180,171,pray mr knightley how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday,something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00215,Emma,Mr. Knightley,182,20,come i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00216,Emma,Mr. Knightley,184,1256,oh to be sure it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her,time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself the feelings of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for her she deserves a better fate,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
00217,Emma,Mr. Knightley,186,1031,i saw her answer nothing could be clearer,the joke seemed confined to you and mr churchill my dear emma do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00218,Emma,Mr. Knightley,188,169,and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over,you are expecting her again you say this morning,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
00219,Emma,Mr. Knightley,190,978,i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation,will you,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
00220,Emma,Mr. Knightley,192,1323,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin,nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00221,Emma,Mr. Knightley,194,418,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess,i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00222,Emma,Mr. Knightley,196,444,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her,he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00223,Emma,Mr. Knightley,198,1160,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00224,Emma,Mr. Knightley,200,1270,i am very much obliged to you if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well,he trifles here as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00225,Emma,Mr. Knightley,298,428,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
00226,Emma,Mr. Knightley,300,420,to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong,it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00227,Emma,Mr. Knightley,302,1359,a material difference then and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer,you ought to know your friend best but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00228,Emma,Mr. Knightley,304,840,but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently,so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
00229,Emma,Mr. Knightley,306,303,that s true very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed,yes a good deal nearer,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00230,Emma,Mr. Knightley,402,179,i am ready if the others are,well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00231,Emma,Mr. Knightley,415,842,i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him,no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00232,Emma,Mr. Knightley,417,305,how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature,i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00233,Emma,Mr. Knightley,419,199,that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00234,Emma,Mr. Knightley,421,1347,yes sometimes he can,i do not know which it ought to be called,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
00235,Emma,Mr. Knightley,423,432,it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others,yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00236,Emma,Mr. Knightley,425,1327,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable,how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00237,Emma,Mr. Knightley,427,1252,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it,if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
00238,Emma,Mr. Knightley,429,299,oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life,if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00239,Emma,Mr. Knightley,431,647,we shall never agree about him but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others,yes but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00240,Emma,Mr. Knightley,433,1335,your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else,my emma he means no such thing he only means,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
00241,Emma,Mr. Knightley,435,1349,you seem determined to think ill of him,i am afraid i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
00242,Emma,Mr. Knightley,437,1351,well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else,there is one subject i hope but one on which we do not think alike does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith have you heard from her yourself this morning you have i believe and know the whole,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00243,Emma,Mr. Knightley,439,1250,my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him,have i of what nature,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00244,Emma,Mr. Knightley,441,1266,i will say no more about him you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here,thank you you are going in i suppose,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
00245,Emma,Mr. Knightley,443,1357,but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour,it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00257,Emma,Mr. Knightley,839,189,you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you,not harriet s equal no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match,Mr. Knightley; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00258,Emma,Mr. Knightley,841,969,no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married,i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections,Mr. Knightley; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
00259,Emma,Mr. Knightley,843,193,well and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement,Mr. Knightley; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00260,Emma,Mr. Knightley,845,403,in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau,shall i ring the bell,Mr. Knightley; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

00264,Emma,Mr. Knightley,970,1262,can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong,he is a most fortunate man so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00265,Emma,Mr. Knightley,972,422,i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders,and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

00270,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1032,197,between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00273,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1135,885,oh i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her,oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00274,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1159,1258,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme,emma are you indeed no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature,Harriet Smith; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00276,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1251,1136,oh the best nature in the world a wedding,they are blended i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00278,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1255,442,you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but i seem to have been doomed to blindness,prejudiced i am not prejudiced,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
00279,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1257,430,you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier,our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00280,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1259,416,mr knightley i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him,i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00287,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1273,440,you had better go on,and mine is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00294,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1324,1268,but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it,as a friend emma that i fear is a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding my dearest emma for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said you are silent absolutely silent at present i ask no more i cannot make speeches emma if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice i shall be very glad to look it over but it seems long i will take it home with me at night i would rather be talking to you but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s we will not be severe it will be natural for me to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00295,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1326,434,i am sure you were of use to me i was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen,i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00296,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1328,1264,what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance,and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined i see to have no curiosity you are wise but i cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00297,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1330,1355,i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again,i mean that he has done it and been accepted,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
00298,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1332,307,impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse,a man cannot be more so,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1
00299,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1334,486,he writes like a sensible man i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him,no not at randalls i have not been near randalls,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
00300,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1336,426,he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00301,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1338,1254,oh if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther,i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00302,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1340,586,if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that,how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00304,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1348,1339,oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile,ah i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00305,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1350,1280,indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too,well there is feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands come he knows himself there those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00307,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1354,1274,you mistake me you quite mistake me it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it,the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could i perfectly agree with you sir you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00308,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1356,195,good god well well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00309,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1358,1353,you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well her connexions may be worse than his in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before,you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin it is so indeed i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00310,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1360,1341,upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox,yes yes but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings what has he been judging by i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00311,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1362,1329,oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are,mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00313,Emma,Mr. Knightley,1366,1367,i hope so for at that time i was a fool,and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00314,Mr. Woodhouse,Harriet Smith,35,244,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not,Emma; Harriet Smith; Miss Bates; Mrs. Bates,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

00316,Harriet Smith,Emma,36,152,two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people,nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00317,Harriet Smith,Emma,38,785,and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her,there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00318,Harriet Smith,Emma,40,53,oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can,you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00319,Harriet Smith,Emma,42,1235,oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often,might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin he might have mr martin s interest in view,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00320,Harriet Smith,Emma,44,37,to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight,well done mrs martin you know what you are about,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00321,Harriet Smith,Emma,46,47,he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd,only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00322,Harriet Smith,Emma,48,660,six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old,just as they always do very vulgar,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00323,Harriet Smith,Emma,50,154,to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year,one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00324,Harriet Smith,Emma,52,45,yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do,i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00325,Harriet Smith,Emma,54,209,to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain,i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00326,Harriet Smith,Emma,56,668,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen,very likely i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
00327,Harriet Smith,Emma,58,213,certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man,this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00328,Harriet Smith,Emma,60,225,oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty,the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00329,Harriet Smith,Emma,62,142,there is no saying indeed,not for the world would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00335,Harriet Smith,Emma,133,1007,yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me,harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00338,Harriet Smith,Emma,139,144,i had no notion that he liked me so very much,perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm now i am secure of you for ever,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00339,Harriet Smith,Emma,141,275,oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no,to fall in with each other on such an errand as this to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were anywhere else this would soon have led to something better of course any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart if i could but have kept longer away,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00340,Harriet Smith,Emma,143,158,miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right,has he so then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00341,Harriet Smith,Emma,145,997,you could not have visited me no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world,my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00342,Harriet Smith,Emma,147,55,dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more,he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00343,Harriet Smith,Emma,149,520,i do not think he is conceited either in general at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration,my dear dear anxious friend always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00344,Harriet Smith,Emma,151,1011,oh no and it is but a short letter too oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say i shall never be invited to abbey mill again,it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any means engage for its being returned consider what you are about perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00345,Harriet Smith,Emma,153,138,and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper,i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
00346,Harriet Smith,Emma,155,511,now he has got my letter i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00347,Harriet Smith,Emma,157,1221,my picture but he has left my picture in bond street,i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00348,Harriet Smith,Emma,206,993,what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman can it be neptune or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out,i do remember it i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00349,Harriet Smith,Emma,208,1223,dear miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse whatever you say is always right and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me,harriet what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
00350,Harriet Smith,Emma,210,1001,it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do take place,and when will there be a beginning of mr churchill,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
00351,Harriet Smith,Emma,212,227,that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole,very well a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must let me read it to him my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00352,Harriet Smith,Emma,214,1233,yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it,have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

00354,Harriet Smith,Emma,218,61,it is as long again as almost all we have had before,which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00355,Harriet Smith,Emma,220,136,it is one thing to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this such sweet lines these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that,ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it you mean to return a favourable answer i collect,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00356,Harriet Smith,Emma,222,1227,oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good,not quite for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00357,Harriet Smith,Emma,224,217,oh but those two lines are,i never read one more to the purpose certainly,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
00358,Harriet Smith,Emma,226,39,i shall never let that book go out of my own hands,mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

00360,Harriet Smith,Emma,256,59,i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are,mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00361,Harriet Smith,Emma,258,995,ah so you say but i cannot believe it,well go on,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
00362,Harriet Smith,Emma,260,65,dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so,how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00363,Harriet Smith,Emma,262,271,but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates,and really i do not think the impression will soon be over i do not think it will,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00364,Harriet Smith,Emma,264,108,but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful,what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00365,Harriet Smith,Emma,266,148,dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old,dear affectionate creature you banished to abbey mill farm you confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00366,Harriet Smith,Emma,268,259,do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted,i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00367,Harriet Smith,Emma,270,49,very true poor creatures one can think of nothing else,well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00368,Harriet Smith,Emma,272,982,oh dear no,yes i hope i do,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
00369,Harriet Smith,Emma,274,156,oh dear yes,let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00370,Harriet Smith,Emma,510,257,oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answered and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can t tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr cole s stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again,my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00371,Harriet Smith,Emma,512,794,very true would not think about it,perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00372,Harriet Smith,Emma,519,255,will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford,i do not often walk this way now but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury i wish we could contrive it but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00373,Harriet Smith,Emma,653,67,oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax,in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00375,Harriet Smith,Emma,657,130,well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution,what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

00384,Harriet Smith,Emma,791,211,i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love,when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00385,Harriet Smith,Emma,793,150,i dare say i dare say she was very much attached to him,thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00386,Harriet Smith,Emma,981,273,miss woodhouse if you are at leisure i have something that i should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then you know it will be over it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish to have no reserves with you on this subject as i am happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it i do not want to say more than is necessary i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me,ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00387,Harriet Smith,Emma,983,51,how i could so long a time be fancying myself it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now i do not care whether i meet him or not except that of the two i had rather not see him and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him but i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget her look the other night however i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy what i ought to have destroyed long ago what i ought never to have kept i know that very well however now i will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown cannot you guess what this parcel holds,i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00388,Harriet Smith,Emma,985,265,no i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much now you must recollect,never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00389,Harriet Smith,Emma,987,666,dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat,she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

00391,Harriet Smith,Emma,992,1237,here here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did this was really his do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment,harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00392,Harriet Smith,Emma,994,221,ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now,leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00396,Harriet Smith,Emma,1002,267,i shall never marry,if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00399,Harriet Smith,Emma,1008,215,oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially,i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00400,Harriet Smith,Emma,1010,999,service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness,but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

00402,Harriet Smith,Emma,1216,146,about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it,indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00403,Harriet Smith,Emma,1218,261,oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd had you any idea of his being in love with her you perhaps might you who can see into every body s heart but nobody else,i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00404,Harriet Smith,Emma,1220,207,me why should you caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill,mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen for miss read miss smith that is court that is ship plain as it can be now for the cream courtship you know a very proper compliment and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00406,Harriet Smith,Emma,1224,263,i should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if you who had been always acquainted with him,that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00407,Harriet Smith,Emma,1226,1217,to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible,what did mr weston tell you,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

00409,Harriet Smith,Emma,1230,1009,oh dear now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth,i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
00410,Harriet Smith,Emma,1232,128,you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it is possible i do not wonder miss woodhouse that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure,yes indeed a very good letter so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet than i had expected,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00411,Harriet Smith,Emma,1234,1229,yes i must say that i have,my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00412,Harriet Smith,Emma,1236,788,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful,oh yes very a very pleasing young woman,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

00415,Emma,Harriet Smith,43,661,that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it,they told me something but it is nothing of any consequence they told me that mr martin dined with them last saturday,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0

00417,Emma,Harriet Smith,47,262,only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable,but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
00418,Emma,Harriet Smith,49,155,well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet,now he has got my letter i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
00419,Emma,Harriet Smith,51,998,i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you,yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00420,Emma,Harriet Smith,53,655,you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education,oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00421,Emma,Harriet Smith,55,1224,he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility,i should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if you who had been always acquainted with him,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00422,Emma,Harriet Smith,57,145,i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here,you could not have visited me no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00423,Emma,Harriet Smith,59,784,mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00424,Emma,Harriet Smith,61,56,which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00425,Emma,Harriet Smith,63,274,but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss,oh dear yes,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00426,Emma,Harriet Smith,65,1226,how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us,to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00428,Emma,Harriet Smith,126,657,upon my word the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can,well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00429,Emma,Harriet Smith,128,1000,yes indeed a very good letter so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet than i had expected,i shall be happier to burn it it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

00434,Emma,Harriet Smith,140,684,i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you,aye that will be much best i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

00441,Emma,Harriet Smith,154,791,one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves,i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
00442,Emma,Harriet Smith,156,137,let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name,no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

00445,Emma,Harriet Smith,211,272,when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage,oh dear no,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

00459,Emma,Harriet Smith,263,795,that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried,yes and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00460,Emma,Harriet Smith,265,258,never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm,ah so you say but i cannot believe it,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
00461,Emma,Harriet Smith,267,127,if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me,will you read the letter pray do i d rather you would well well is it a good letter or is it too short,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
00462,Emma,Harriet Smith,269,1216,oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind,about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00464,Emma,Harriet Smith,273,66,ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves,i wonder he did not remember the book,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
00465,Emma,Harriet Smith,511,143,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it,miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

00467,Emma,Harriet Smith,656,793,those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax s is much beyond it,i dare say i dare say she was very much attached to him,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

00469,Emma,Harriet Smith,660,40,just as they always do very vulgar,oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00470,Emma,Harriet Smith,666,50,she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be,to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00472,Emma,Harriet Smith,683,46,that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford,he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd,Harriet Smith; Mrs. Ford,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00473,Emma,Harriet Smith,783,228,your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me,oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00475,Emma,Harriet Smith,790,214,very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown,yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00476,Emma,Harriet Smith,792,216,oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune and she came in his way,i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00477,Emma,Harriet Smith,794,153,perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have,and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00479,Emma,Harriet Smith,984,54,not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing,to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00480,Emma,Harriet Smith,986,268,no indeed i do not,do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
00481,Emma,Harriet Smith,988,789,my dearest harriet you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well go on what else,i think her beautiful quite beautiful,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00482,Emma,Harriet Smith,993,1232,i do remember it i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here,you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it is possible i do not wonder miss woodhouse that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00483,Emma,Harriet Smith,995,1236,well go on,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00484,Emma,Harriet Smith,997,226,my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things,i shall never let that book go out of my own hands,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
00485,Emma,Harriet Smith,999,44,but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful,to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00486,Emma,Harriet Smith,1003,987,never marry this is a new resolution,dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00487,Emma,Harriet Smith,1005,659,i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton,are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00488,Emma,Harriet Smith,1007,270,harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so,very true poor creatures one can think of nothing else,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
00489,Emma,Harriet Smith,1009,989,i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart,and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00490,Emma,Harriet Smith,1215,220,what news do you mean,it is one thing to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this such sweet lines these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00491,Emma,Harriet Smith,1217,1218,what did mr weston tell you,oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd had you any idea of his being in love with her you perhaps might you who can see into every body s heart but nobody else,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00492,Emma,Harriet Smith,1219,149,upon my word i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly,i do not think he is conceited either in general at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00493,Emma,Harriet Smith,1221,264,i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him,but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
00494,Emma,Harriet Smith,1223,212,harriet what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then,that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00583,Mr. Woodhouse,Isabella,325,330,that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season,i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill,Emma; Isabella,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00584,Mr. Woodhouse,Isabella,327,342,ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad,i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly,Emma; Isabella,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00596,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,319,329,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august,ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00598,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,324,337,how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00599,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,326,316,no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00600,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,328,284,no indeed we are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air,not near so often my dear as i could wish,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00601,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,330,323,i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill,why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00602,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,336,345,that sweet amiable jane fairfax it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00604,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,340,313,but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children a great deal of good,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00605,Isabella,Mr. Woodhouse,342,341,i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly,and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00607,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,281,357,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret,such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now,Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00608,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,285,282,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth,very much to the honour of both,Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

00610,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,354,359,mr elton s manners are not perfect but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot but value,i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do,Mr. John Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00611,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,356,936,me are you imagining me to be mr elton s object,i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately,Mr. John Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

00613,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,360,286,i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied,Mr. John Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00614,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,933,361,i rather hope to satisfy you both for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic,a man must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home,Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00615,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,935,940,that is very likely you think so do not you,there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great,Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00616,Emma,Mr. John Knightley,939,289,difference no indeed i am not,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can,Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00618,Mr. John Knightley,Isabella,289,290,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor,Emma; Isabella; Mr. Woodhouse,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00681,Mrs. Weston,Emma,390,631,one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her,i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00686,Mrs. Weston,Emma,620,389,oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming,he ought to come if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00687,Mrs. Weston,Emma,622,633,very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them,but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00688,Mrs. Weston,Emma,624,884,well you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company what do you say to it,well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00689,Mrs. Weston,Emma,626,623,my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter,very likely nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00693,Mrs. Weston,Emma,634,643,my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax,you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment i believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00695,Mrs. Weston,Emma,638,393,for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love,i shall not be satisfied unless he comes,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
00696,Mrs. Weston,Emma,640,1205,i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him,and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00699,Mrs. Weston,Emma,883,1193,he chose to say he was employed,i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00786,Emma,Miss Bates,456,455,you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell,so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things,Harriet Smith; Miss Bates,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00788,Emma,Miss Bates,460,465,i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax,and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her,Harriet Smith; Miss Bates,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00789,Emma,Miss Bates,462,1157,yes that of course,yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now said she said she and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s,Harriet Smith; Miss Bates,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00878,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,523,1074,elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston,you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
00879,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,537,1097,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before,your gallantry is really unanswerable but,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
00880,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,539,1373,ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion,i can never think of it without extreme shame,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
00881,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,541,544,i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion,oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00882,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,543,1089,ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom i dare say they sell gloves,it is hotter to day,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
00883,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,545,608,but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life,were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00884,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,547,675,and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow,i do not believe any such thing i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion last night,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00885,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,549,1091,may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all,you are comfortable because you are under command,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00886,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,554,555,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play,ever hear her you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00887,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,556,1381,you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof,i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00888,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,558,557,yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof,proof indeed mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00889,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,560,1383,it was her very particular friend you know,not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us if not in our dispositions there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00890,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,562,774,you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it,not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00891,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,564,610,as to that i do not,the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00892,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,566,1385,there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be,very beautiful indeed,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
00893,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,568,1095,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person,dating from three o clock yesterday my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00894,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,591,1375,nay why do you,i never had the smallest i assure you,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1
00895,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,595,772,perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before,as you do us such ample justice now i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury and you must be off this very morning,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00896,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,597,1070,that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house,i am glad i have done being in love with him i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning harriet s sweet easy temper will not mind it,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00897,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,599,538,i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be,and how did you think miss fairfax looking,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
00898,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,601,735,mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00899,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,603,776,mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance,you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00900,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,605,1084,and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided,these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
00901,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,607,697,he did i was there one of the party,you speak too plain she must understand you,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00902,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,609,567,i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries,i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00903,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,611,1377,and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells,it is not now worth a regret,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
00904,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,613,592,indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love i have made a most wretched discovery i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection,me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00905,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,615,614,no that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen,perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00906,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,672,600,me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do,what do you say to mrs dixon,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00907,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,674,1371,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00908,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,692,548,i have not been working uninterruptedly i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home whoever colonel campbell might employ the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so,upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00909,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,696,1093,conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam of restoring your spectacles healed for the present if you are very kind it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth here is something quite new to me do you know it cramer and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it he knew miss fairfax could have no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it,perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00912,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,727,569,we were too magnificent we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well,not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal,Emma; Mr. Weston; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00915,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,734,606,yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent i hope you consent,and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00916,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,742,559,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited,certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00917,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,745,1087,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole,yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00918,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,765,561,of all horrid things leave taking is the worst,poor comfort one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00920,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,769,546,ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right,i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00921,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,771,770,if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement such a fortnight as it has been every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury,indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

00923,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,775,766,yes i have called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then in short perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00925,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,953,1076,jane that is easy but miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose,you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00929,Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,1069,604,as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met one as i came madness in such weather absolute madness,yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00955,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,538,613,and how did you think miss fairfax looking,indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love i have made a most wretched discovery i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00956,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,540,1386,it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face well there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion,how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks i would not have missed this meeting for the world i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00957,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,542,1374,did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society,the shame is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know you had none,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00958,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,544,607,oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues,he did i was there one of the party,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
00959,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,546,554,i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
00960,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,548,1079,upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her,no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
00961,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,550,1372,you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be,is not she looking well better than she ever used to do you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00962,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,553,674,i certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00963,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,555,1083,ever hear her you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly,but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think of you all there without me,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00964,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,557,556,proof indeed mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year,you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00965,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,559,777,certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it,it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
00966,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,561,736,poor comfort one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland,i was going to observe sir that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00967,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,563,769,so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction,ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00968,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,565,1384,oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses,true true no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00969,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,567,539,i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved,ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00970,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,590,775,why do you smile,yes i have called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then in short perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00971,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,594,773,i rather wonder that it was never made before,yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00972,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,596,1075,or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body,i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00973,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,598,566,you may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine,there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00974,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,600,609,what do you say to mrs dixon,i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00975,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,602,1127,if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon in them,by all means if you can,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
00976,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,604,599,yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are,i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00977,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,606,698,and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her,i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
00978,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,608,549,were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries,may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00979,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,610,1081,the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon,no it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
00980,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,612,1094,no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business,it comes to the same thing i can have no self command without a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can be always with me you are always with me,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00981,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,614,1077,perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut,no i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
00982,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,616,568,what is the matter,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
00983,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,673,1099,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument,i say nothing of which i am ashamed i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

00985,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,697,564,you speak too plain she must understand you,as to that i do not,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
00986,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,699,605,but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea,and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00987,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,701,558,she is not entirely without it i think,yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

00991,Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,735,547,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,major,Emma,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01119,Jane Fairfax,Mr. John Knightley,856,861,i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters,when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have,Mr. John Knightley,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01123,Jane Fairfax,Mr. John Knightley,875,876,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder,the clerks grow expert from habit they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you want any farther explanation they are paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity the public pays and must be served well,Mr. John Knightley,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

01238,Mrs. Norris,Sir Thomas,1,745,my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister,my daughters have their pleasures at brighton and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at mansfield will be for their cousins could we be all assembled our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement,Lady Bertram; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01272,Mrs. Norris,Lady Bertram,842,64,now william would be able to keep himself which would make a vast difference to his uncle for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle and indeed it would make some difference in her presents too she was very glad that she had given william what she did at parting very glad indeed that it had been in her power without material inconvenience just at that time to give him something rather considerable that is for her with her limited means for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin she knew he must be at some expense that he would have many things to buy though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it,is she not to live with you i thought you had settled it with sir thomas,Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

01285,Edmund,Fanny Price,16,378,and when shall you do it,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01286,Edmund,Fanny Price,18,601,if that be all your difficulty i will furnish you with paper and every other material and you may write your letter whenever you choose would it make you happy to write to william,to morrow i think my uncle dines at sotherton and you and mr bertram too we shall be quite a small party at home i hope my uncle may continue to like mr rushworth,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

01290,Edmund,Fanny Price,47,929,it has everything else in its favour my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you she is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought and i am glad her love of money does not interfere you will be what you ought to be to her i hope it does not distress you very much fanny,as a bystander perhaps i saw more than you did and i do think that mr rushworth was sometimes very jealous,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01291,Edmund,Fanny Price,49,927,i can say nothing for her manner to you as a child but it was the same with us all or nearly so she never knew how to be pleasant to children but you are now of an age to be treated better i think she is behaving better already and when you are her only companion you must be important to her,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01292,Edmund,Fanny Price,51,915,what is to prevent you,i am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what i feel,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
01293,Edmund,Fanny Price,53,386,as to your foolishness and awkwardness my dear fanny believe me you never have a shadow of either but in using the words so improperly there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known you have good sense and a sweet temper and i am sure you have a grateful heart that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion,i am rather surprised that mr crawford should come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven weeks for i had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone to take him elsewhere he is used to much gayer places than mansfield,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01294,Edmund,Fanny Price,55,597,why indeed fanny i should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the white house you speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park but you will belong to us almost as much as ever the two families will be meeting every day in the year the only difference will be that living with your aunt you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be here there are too many whom you can hide behind but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself,and i longed to do it but there was such a dead silence and while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word or seeming at all interested in the subject i did not like i thought it would appear as if i wanted to set myself off at their expense by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01295,Edmund,Fanny Price,57,50,i must say it and say it with pleasure mrs norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers,i can never be important to any one,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
01296,Edmund,Fanny Price,59,760,the place fanny is what you will not quit though you quit the house you will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change you will have the same walks to frequent the same library to choose from the same people to look at the same horse to ride,no i have not been out at all,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
01297,Edmund,Fanny Price,143,941,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny,i knew she would be very angry with me,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
01298,Edmund,Fanny Price,145,390,have you never been there no you never can and unluckily it is out of distance for a ride i wish we could contrive it,if miss bertram were not engaged i could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than julia,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01299,Edmund,Fanny Price,175,373,well fanny and how do you like miss crawford now how did you like her yesterday,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01300,Edmund,Fanny Price,177,925,it is her countenance that is so attractive she has a wonderful play of feature but was there nothing in her conversation that struck you fanny as not quite right,we are so totally unlike we are so very very different in all our inclinations and ways that i consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together even if i could like him there never were two people more dissimilar we have not one taste in common we should be miserable,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01301,Edmund,Fanny Price,179,595,i thought you would be struck it was very wrong very indecorous,but i do talk to him more than i used i am sure i do did not you hear me ask him about the slave trade last night,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
01302,Edmund,Fanny Price,181,517,ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt s memory which misleads her here she is awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs crawford without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements though the admiral s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely i do not censure her opinions but there certainly is impropriety in making them public,i am sorry for miss crawford but i am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle it will be such a triumph to the others,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
01303,Edmund,Fanny Price,183,764,that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection,the effect of education,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
01304,Edmund,Fanny Price,193,246,i do not want her at all for myself but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home i think miss crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mansfield common mrs grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any morning will do for this she would be extremely sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health,it was foolish of me not to think of all that but i am disappointed,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
01305,Edmund,Fanny Price,199,762,fanny i am sure you have the headache i can hardly believe you i know your looks too well how long have you had it,i am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you this ought to be a day of pleasure my uncle meant it so,Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mrs. Norris,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01306,Edmund,Fanny Price,245,690,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements,will he not feel this no he can feel nothing as he ought,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
01307,Edmund,Fanny Price,289,1014,you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot for there is not the least wit in my nature i am a very matter of fact plain spoken being and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out,and what what could you say cruel quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01308,Edmund,Fanny Price,358,290,which you suppose has biassed me,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01309,Edmund,Fanny Price,360,931,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly,before the play i am much mistaken if julia did not think he was paying her attentions,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
01310,Edmund,Fanny Price,369,52,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away,everything my situation my foolishness and awkwardness,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
01311,Edmund,Fanny Price,372,194,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant,i shall not ride to morrow certainly i have been out very often lately and would rather stay at home you know i am strong enough now to walk very well,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
01312,Edmund,Fanny Price,377,752,there goes good humour i am sure there goes a temper which would never give pain how well she walks and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others joining them the moment she is asked what a pity that she should have been in such hands,no no it is not i want to consult you oh this is beautiful indeed this is the very thing precisely what i wished for this is the only ornament i have ever had a desire to possess it will exactly suit my cross they must and shall be worn together it comes too in such an acceptable moment oh cousin you do not know how acceptable it is,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01313,Edmund,Fanny Price,379,182,i like to hear your enthusiasm fanny it is a lovely night and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel in some degree as you do who have not at least been given a taste for nature in early life they lose a great deal,do not you think that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon mrs crawford as her niece has been entirely brought up by her she cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the admiral,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01317,Edmund,Fanny Price,387,58,it is to his credit and i dare say it gives his sister pleasure she does not like his unsettled habits,i cannot see things as you do but i ought to believe you to be right rather than myself and i am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be if i could suppose my aunt really to care for me it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody here i know i am of none and yet i love the place so well,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01318,Edmund,Fanny Price,389,184,yes his manners to women are such as must please mrs grant i believe suspects him of a preference for julia i have never seen much symptom of it but i wish it may be so he has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove,yes except as to his writing her such short letters she made me almost laugh but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters when they are separated i am sure william would never have used me so under any circumstances and what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01319,Edmund,Fanny Price,436,939,i have no hope there fanny if they persist in the scheme they will find something i shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them and that is all i can do,it is above a week since i saw miss crawford,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1

01322,Edmund,Fanny Price,512,937,yes your advice and opinion i do not know what to do this acting scheme gets worse and worse you see they have chosen almost as bad a play as they could and now to complete the business are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us this is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first i know no harm of charles maddox but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable the more than intimacy the familiarity i cannot think of it with any patience and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must if possible be prevented do not you see it in the same light,was mrs grant in the room then,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
01323,Edmund,Fanny Price,514,754,there is but one thing to be done fanny i must take anhalt myself i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom it is not at all what i like no man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency after being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect but i can think of no other alternative can you fanny,if it had been given to me in the first instance i should not have thought of returning it but being her brother s present is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it when it is not wanted,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01324,Edmund,Fanny Price,516,945,but what i see your judgment is not with me think it a little over perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief that may of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man s being received in this manner domesticated among us authorised to come at all hours and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints to think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create it is all very bad put yourself in miss crawford s place fanny consider what it would be to act amelia with a stranger she has a right to be felt for because she evidently feels for herself i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be it would be ungenerous it would be really wrong to expose her to it her feelings ought to be respected does it not strike you so fanny you hesitate,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01325,Edmund,Fanny Price,518,144,they will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously i act but however triumph there certainly will be and i must brave it but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business of limiting the exhibition of concentrating our folly i shall be well repaid as i am now i have no influence i can do nothing i have offended them and they will not hear me but when i have put them in good humour by this concession i am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for this will be a material gain my object is to confine it to mrs rushworth and the grants will not this be worth gaining,i should like to see sotherton before it is cut down to see the place as it is now in its old state but i do not suppose i shall,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01326,Edmund,Fanny Price,520,919,but still it has not your approbation can you mention any other measure by which i have a chance of doing equal good,my uncle thought me wrong and i knew he had been talking to you,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
01327,Edmund,Fanny Price,522,176,give me your approbation then fanny i am not comfortable without it,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01328,Edmund,Fanny Price,524,361,if you are against me i ought to distrust myself and yet but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act no matter whom the look of a gentleman is to be enough i thought you would have entered more into miss crawford s feelings,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01329,Edmund,Fanny Price,526,525,she never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night it gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill,no doubt she will be very glad it must be a great relief to her,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
01330,Edmund,Fanny Price,588,46,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father,oh cousin,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
01331,Edmund,Fanny Price,590,380,i believe you are right fanny i believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were than assuming a new character the novelty was in their being lively yet how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give i have been feeling as if we had never lived so before,you taught me to think and feel on the subject cousin,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
01332,Edmund,Fanny Price,592,523,why should you dare say that do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet but when did you or anybody ever get a compliment from me fanny go to my father if you want to be complimented he will satisfy you ask your uncle what he thinks and you will hear compliments enough and though they may be chiefly on your person you must put up with it and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time your uncle thinks you very pretty dear fanny and that is the long and the short of the matter anybody but myself would have made something more of it and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before but the truth is that your uncle never did admire you till now and now he does your complexion is so improved and you have gained so much countenance and your figure nay fanny do not turn away about it it is but an uncle if you cannot bear an uncle s admiration what is to become of you you must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at you must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman,oh cousin,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
01333,Edmund,Fanny Price,594,921,your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect and i only wish you would talk to him more you are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle,oh never never never he never will succeed with me,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
01334,Edmund,Fanny Price,596,521,i did and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others it would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther,no i cannot think of anything else,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
01335,Edmund,Fanny Price,598,146,miss crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect we were talking of you at the parsonage and those were her words she has great discernment i know nobody who distinguishes characters better for so young a woman it is remarkable she certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long and with regard to some others i can perceive from occasional lively hints the unguarded expressions of the moment that she could define many as accurately did not delicacy forbid it i wonder what she thinks of my father she must admire him as a fine looking man with most gentlemanlike dignified consistent manners but perhaps having seen him so seldom his reserve may be a little repulsive could they be much together i feel sure of their liking each other he would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers i wish they met more frequently i hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side,oh it does not signify whenever i do see it you will tell me how it has been altered,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
01336,Edmund,Fanny Price,600,935,this is the first october that she has passed in the country since her infancy i do not call tunbridge or cheltenham the country and november is a still more serious month and i can see that mrs grant is very anxious for her not finding mansfield dull as winter comes on,i would not engage in such a charge in such an office of high responsibility,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

01340,Edmund,Fanny Price,749,54,fanny i beg your pardon for being here i came to look for you and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand you will find the beginning of a note to yourself but i can now speak my business which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle a chain for william s cross you ought to have had it a week ago but there has been a delay from my brother s not being in town by several days so soon as i expected and i have only just now received it at northampton i hope you will like the chain itself fanny i endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste but at any rate i know you will be kind to my intentions and consider it as it really is a token of the love of one of your oldest friends,you are too kind how shall i ever thank you as i ought for thinking so well of me oh cousin if i am to go away i shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

01343,Edmund,Fanny Price,755,13,she must not suppose it not wanted not acceptable at least and its having been originally her brother s gift makes no difference for as she was not prevented from offering nor you from taking it on that account it ought not to prevent you from keeping it no doubt it is handsomer than mine and fitter for a ballroom,no no not at all no thank you william did not like she should come away he had told her he should miss her very much indeed,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
01344,Edmund,Fanny Price,757,23,for one night fanny for only one night if it be a sacrifice i am sure you will upon consideration make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort miss crawford s attentions to you have been not more than you were justly entitled to i am the last person to think that could be but they have been invariable and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude though i know it could never have the meaning is not in your nature i am sure wear the necklace as you are engaged to do to morrow evening and let the chain which was not ordered with any reference to the ball be kept for commoner occasions this is my advice i would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy i have been observing with the greatest pleasure and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences resulting principally from situation no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship i would not have the shadow of a coolness arise between the two dearest objects i have on earth,my uncle,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

01350,Edmund,Fanny Price,769,599,dearest fanny you are all considerate thought but it is unnecessary here the time will never come no such time as you allude to will ever come i begin to think it most improbable the chances grow less and less and even if it should there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of for i can never be ashamed of my own scruples and if they are removed it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had you are the only being upon earth to whom i should say what i have said but you have always known my opinion of her you can bear me witness fanny that i have never been blinded how many a time have we talked over her little errors you need not fear me i have almost given up every serious idea of her but i must be a blockhead indeed if whatever befell me i could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude,she must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you to have any such apprehension and sir thomas s wishing just at first to be only with his family is so very natural that she can argue nothing from that after a little while i dare say we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way allowing for the difference of the time of year,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01352,Edmund,Fanny Price,914,591,not of facts perhaps but of feelings fanny no one but you can tell me them i do not mean to press you however if it is not what you wish yourself i have done i had thought it might be a relief,i suppose i am graver than other people the evenings do not appear long to me i love to hear my uncle talk of the west indies i could listen to him for an hour together it entertains me more than many other things have done but then i am unlike other people i dare say,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
01353,Edmund,Fanny Price,916,758,do you suppose that we think differently i have no idea of it i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be to the point i consider crawford s proposals as most advantageous and desirable if you could return his affection i consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it but that as you cannot you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him can there be any disagreement between us here,suppose i were to find him there again to day,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
01354,Edmund,Fanny Price,918,947,this comfort you might have had sooner fanny had you sought it but how could you possibly suppose me against you how could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love were i even careless in general on such matters how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake,you were near staying there,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
01355,Edmund,Fanny Price,920,1018,as far as you have gone fanny i think you perfectly right i may be sorry i may be surprised though hardly that for you had not had time to attach yourself but i think you perfectly right can it admit of a question it is disgraceful to us if it does you did not love him nothing could have justified your accepting him so far your conduct has been faultless and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise but the matter does not end here crawford s is no common attachment he perseveres with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before this we know must be a work of time but let him succeed at last fanny let him succeed at last you have proved yourself upright and disinterested prove yourself grateful and tender hearted and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which i have always believed you born for,how long were you together,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
01356,Edmund,Fanny Price,922,513,never fanny so very determined and positive this is not like yourself your rational self,yes but what can be done your brother is so determined,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
01357,Edmund,Fanny Price,924,17,i must hope better things i am aware more aware than crawford can be that the man who means to make you love him you having due notice of his intentions must have very uphill work for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate which so many years growth have confirmed and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation i know that the apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for a time be arming you against him i wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do fanny between us i think we should have won you my theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as i firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference,she did not know she had not any paper,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
01358,Edmund,Fanny Price,926,770,you are mistaken fanny the dissimilarity is not so strong you are quite enough alike you have tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in common you have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions you forget yourself there is a decided difference in your tempers i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheerfulness will counteract this he sees difficulties nowhere and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike fanny does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together do not imagine it i am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination for much or little company in the propensity to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i exclude extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme a counteraction gentle and continual is the best safeguard of manners and conduct,yes cousin i am convinced that you would be incapable of anything else though perhaps some might not i cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say do not check yourself tell me whatever you like,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01359,Edmund,Fanny Price,928,673,my dear fanny let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong crawford was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest were blameless i was playing the fool with my eyes open,the new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin s marriage i hope it is not too fine but i thought i ought to wear it as soon as i could and that i might not have such another opportunity all the winter i hope you do not think me too fine,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01360,Edmund,Fanny Price,930,593,very possibly no wonder nothing could be more improper than the whole business i am shocked whenever i think that maria could be capable of it but if she could undertake the part we must not be surprised at the rest,oh don t talk so don t talk so,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
01361,Edmund,Fanny Price,932,913,julia i have heard before from some one of his being in love with julia but i could never see anything of it and fanny though i hope i do justice to my sisters good qualities i think it very possible that they might one or both be more desirous of being admired by crawford and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent i can remember that they were evidently fond of his society and with such encouragement a man like crawford lively and it may be a little unthinking might be led on to there could be nothing very striking because it is clear that he had no pretensions his heart was reserved for you and i must say that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion it does him the highest honour it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment it proves him unspoilt by his uncle it proves him in short everything that i had been used to wish to believe him and feared he was not,if you hear of it from everybody cousin there can be nothing for me to tell,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01362,Edmund,Fanny Price,934,437,say rather that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects which i believe to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the disadvantages indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are crawford s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed with rare felicity he will make you happy fanny i know he will make you happy but you will make him everything,i should think my aunt norris would be on your side,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
01363,Edmund,Fanny Price,936,933,as usual believing yourself unequal to anything fancying everything too much for you well though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sincerely anxious that you may i have no common interest in crawford s well doing next to your happiness fanny his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in crawford i was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you fanny just as she ought she desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it i should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity,i am persuaded that he does not think as he ought on serious subjects,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
01364,Edmund,Fanny Price,938,359,yes when i reached the house i found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you fanny till crawford and dr grant came in,but that i am sure it has not,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
01365,Edmund,Fanny Price,940,527,yes she laments it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you fanny you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and esteems you with all her heart,she was very kind indeed and i am glad to have her spared,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
01366,Edmund,Fanny Price,942,384,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality,not in the least it is a great while since we have had any star gazing,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
01367,Edmund,Fanny Price,944,923,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me,i mean that i think i never shall as far as the future can be answered for i think i never shall return his regard,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01368,Edmund,Fanny Price,946,589,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01369,Edmund,Fanny Price,948,949,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough,you spent your time pleasantly there,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
01370,Edmund,Fanny Price,950,750,yes that is it was the fault of my own mind if i did not they were all very pleasant i doubt their finding me so i took uneasiness with me and there was no getting rid of it till i was in mansfield again,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
01371,Edmund,Fanny Price,1013,943,said she i could not answer but i believe my looks spoke she felt reproved sometimes how quick to feel with a graver look and voice she then added so she began but how she went on fanny is not fit is hardly fit to be repeated to you i cannot recall all her words i would not dwell upon them if i could their substance was great anger at the folly of each she reprobated her brother s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for to do what must lose him the woman he adored but still more the folly of poor maria in sacrificing such a situation plunging into such difficulties under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear guess what i must have felt to hear the woman whom no harsher name than folly given so voluntarily so freely so coolly to canvass it no reluctance no horror no feminine shall i say no modest loathings this is what the world does for where fanny shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed spoilt spoilt i will tell you everything and then have done for ever she saw it only as folly and that folly stamped only by exposure the want of common discretion of caution his going down to richmond for the whole time of her being at twickenham her putting herself in the power of a servant it was the detection in short oh fanny it was the detection not the offence which she reprobated it was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
01372,Edmund,Fanny Price,1015,178,nothing nothing to be understood i was like a man stunned she went on began to talk of you yes then she began to talk of you regretting as well she might the loss of such a there she spoke very rationally but she has always done justice to you said she my dearest fanny i am giving you i hope more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been but what never can be now you do not wish me to be silent if you do give me but a look a word and i have done thank god now fanny she tried to speak carelessly but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear i only said in reply that from my heart i wished her well and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty to the lessons of affliction and immediately left the room i had gone a few steps fanny when i heard the door open behind me said she i looked back said she with a smile but it was a smile ill suited to the conversation that had passed a saucy playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue me at least it appeared so to me i resisted it was the impulse of the moment to resist and still walked on i have since sometimes for a moment regretted that i did not go back but i know i was right and such has been the end of our acquaintance and what an acquaintance has it been how have i been deceived equally in brother and sister deceived i thank you for your patience fanny this has been the greatest relief and now we will have done we were all disposed to wonder but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer she spoke of you with high praise and warm affection yet even here there was alloy a dash of evil for in the midst of it she could exclaim could you have believed it possible but the charm is broken my eyes are opened cruelty do you call it we differ there no hers is not a cruel nature i do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings the evil lies yet deeper in her total ignorance unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did she was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak as she imagined everybody else would speak hers are not faults of temper she would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one and though i may deceive myself i cannot but think that for me for my feelings she would hers are faults of principle fanny of blunted delicacy and a corrupted vitiated mind perhaps it is best for me since it leaves me so little to regret not so however gladly would i submit to all the increased pain of losing her rather than have to think of her as i do i told her so,oh yes she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did i was quite astonished an uncle with whom she has been living so many years and who whatever his faults may be is so very fond of her brother treating him they say quite like a son i could not have believed it,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01373,Edmund,Fanny Price,1017,768,yes when i left her i told her so,one thing more excuse the liberty but take care how you talk to me do not tell me anything now which hereafter you may be sorry for the time may come,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01374,Fanny Price,Edmund,13,755,no no not at all no thank you william did not like she should come away he had told her he should miss her very much indeed,she must not suppose it not wanted not acceptable at least and its having been originally her brother s gift makes no difference for as she was not prevented from offering nor you from taking it on that account it ought not to prevent you from keeping it no doubt it is handsomer than mine and fitter for a ballroom,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01375,Fanny Price,Edmund,15,920,yes he had promised he would but he had told her to write first,as far as you have gone fanny i think you perfectly right i may be sorry i may be surprised though hardly that for you had not had time to attach yourself but i think you perfectly right can it admit of a question it is disgraceful to us if it does you did not love him nothing could have justified your accepting him so far your conduct has been faultless and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise but the matter does not end here crawford s is no common attachment he perseveres with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before this we know must be a work of time but let him succeed at last fanny let him succeed at last you have proved yourself upright and disinterested prove yourself grateful and tender hearted and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which i have always believed you born for,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01376,Fanny Price,Edmund,17,379,she did not know she had not any paper,i like to hear your enthusiasm fanny it is a lovely night and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel in some degree as you do who have not at least been given a taste for nature in early life they lose a great deal,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
01377,Fanny Price,Edmund,19,598,yes very,miss crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect we were talking of you at the parsonage and those were her words she has great discernment i know nobody who distinguishes characters better for so young a woman it is remarkable she certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long and with regard to some others i can perceive from occasional lively hints the unguarded expressions of the moment that she could define many as accurately did not delicacy forbid it i wonder what she thinks of my father she must admire him as a fine looking man with most gentlemanlike dignified consistent manners but perhaps having seen him so seldom his reserve may be a little repulsive could they be much together i feel sure of their liking each other he would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers i wish they met more frequently i hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01387,Fanny Price,Edmund,58,761,i cannot see things as you do but i ought to believe you to be right rather than myself and i am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be if i could suppose my aunt really to care for me it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody here i know i am of none and yet i love the place so well,then you have had fatigues within doors which are worse you had better have gone out i come from dr grant s you may guess my errand there fanny i wished to engage miss crawford for the two first dances yes she is engaged to me but she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me she is not serious i think i hope i am sure she is not serious but i would rather not hear it she never has danced with a clergyman she says and she never will for my own sake i could wish there had been no ball just at i mean not this very week this very day to morrow i leave home,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01388,Fanny Price,Edmund,60,944,very true yes dear old grey pony ah cousin when i remember how much i used to dread riding what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good oh how i have trembled at my uncle s opening his lips if horses were talked of and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears and convince me that i should like it after a little while and feel how right you proved to be i am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01389,Fanny Price,Edmund,142,391,cut down an avenue what a pity does it not make you think of cowper ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited,which is perhaps more in favour of his liking julia best than you fanny may be aware for i believe it often happens that a man before he has quite made up his own mind will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from maria and i am not at all afraid for her after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01390,Fanny Price,Edmund,144,360,i should like to see sotherton before it is cut down to see the place as it is now in its old state but i do not suppose i shall,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01391,Fanny Price,Edmund,162,928,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters,my dear fanny let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong crawford was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest were blameless i was playing the fool with my eyes open,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01392,Fanny Price,Edmund,176,592,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her,why should you dare say that do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet but when did you or anybody ever get a compliment from me fanny go to my father if you want to be complimented he will satisfy you ask your uncle what he thinks and you will hear compliments enough and though they may be chiefly on your person you must put up with it and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time your uncle thinks you very pretty dear fanny and that is the long and the short of the matter anybody but myself would have made something more of it and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before but the truth is that your uncle never did admire you till now and now he does your complexion is so improved and you have gained so much countenance and your figure nay fanny do not turn away about it it is but an uncle if you cannot bear an uncle s admiration what is to become of you you must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at you must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01393,Fanny Price,Edmund,178,514,oh yes she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did i was quite astonished an uncle with whom she has been living so many years and who whatever his faults may be is so very fond of her brother treating him they say quite like a son i could not have believed it,there is but one thing to be done fanny i must take anhalt myself i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom it is not at all what i like no man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency after being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect but i can think of no other alternative can you fanny,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01394,Fanny Price,Edmund,180,765,and very ungrateful i think,yes that uncle and aunt they have injured the finest mind for sometimes fanny i own to you it does appear more than manner it appears as if the mind itself was tainted,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
01395,Fanny Price,Edmund,182,193,do not you think that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon mrs crawford as her niece has been entirely brought up by her she cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the admiral,i do not want her at all for myself but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home i think miss crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mansfield common mrs grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any morning will do for this she would be extremely sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01396,Fanny Price,Edmund,184,763,yes except as to his writing her such short letters she made me almost laugh but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters when they are separated i am sure william would never have used me so under any circumstances and what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent,oh yes yes and it will be a day of pleasure it will all end right i am only vexed for a moment in fact it is not that i consider the ball as ill timed what does it signify but fanny you know what all this means you see how it is and could tell me perhaps better than i could tell you how and why i am vexed let me talk to you a little you are a kind kind listener i have been pained by her manner this morning and cannot get the better of it i know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own but the influence of her former companions makes her seem gives to her conversation to her professed opinions sometimes a tinge of wrong she does not think evil but she speaks it speaks it in playfulness and though i know it to be playfulness it grieves me to the soul,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01397,Fanny Price,Edmund,192,642,no i do not know not if you want the mare,but my mother will have my father with her all the evening,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
01398,Fanny Price,Edmund,194,1015,i shall not ride to morrow certainly i have been out very often lately and would rather stay at home you know i am strong enough now to walk very well,nothing nothing to be understood i was like a man stunned she went on began to talk of you yes then she began to talk of you regretting as well she might the loss of such a there she spoke very rationally but she has always done justice to you said she my dearest fanny i am giving you i hope more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been but what never can be now you do not wish me to be silent if you do give me but a look a word and i have done thank god now fanny she tried to speak carelessly but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear i only said in reply that from my heart i wished her well and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty to the lessons of affliction and immediately left the room i had gone a few steps fanny when i heard the door open behind me said she i looked back said she with a smile but it was a smile ill suited to the conversation that had passed a saucy playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue me at least it appeared so to me i resisted it was the impulse of the moment to resist and still walked on i have since sometimes for a moment regretted that i did not go back but i know i was right and such has been the end of our acquaintance and what an acquaintance has it been how have i been deceived equally in brother and sister deceived i thank you for your patience fanny this has been the greatest relief and now we will have done we were all disposed to wonder but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer she spoke of you with high praise and warm affection yet even here there was alloy a dash of evil for in the midst of it she could exclaim could you have believed it possible but the charm is broken my eyes are opened cruelty do you call it we differ there no hers is not a cruel nature i do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings the evil lies yet deeper in her total ignorance unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did she was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak as she imagined everybody else would speak hers are not faults of temper she would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one and though i may deceive myself i cannot but think that for me for my feelings she would hers are faults of principle fanny of blunted delicacy and a corrupted vitiated mind perhaps it is best for me since it leaves me so little to regret not so however gladly would i submit to all the increased pain of losing her rather than have to think of her as i do i told her so,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01400,Fanny Price,Edmund,244,934,i am disappointed this is not my idea of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no aisles no arches no inscriptions no banners no banners cousin to be blown by the night wind of heaven no signs that a,say rather that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects which i believe to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the disadvantages indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are crawford s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed with rare felicity he will make you happy fanny i know he will make you happy but you will make him everything,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01401,Fanny Price,Edmund,290,51,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while,what is to prevent you,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
01402,Fanny Price,Edmund,359,183,but that i am sure it has not,that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01403,Fanny Price,Edmund,378,751,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene,if that is all you have to say fanny,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
01404,Fanny Price,Edmund,380,179,you taught me to think and feel on the subject cousin,i thought you would be struck it was very wrong very indecorous,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
01405,Fanny Price,Edmund,382,508,yes and the bear i wish i could see cassiopeia,can i speak with you fanny for a few minutes,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
01406,Fanny Price,Edmund,384,1017,not in the least it is a great while since we have had any star gazing,yes when i left her i told her so,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
01407,Fanny Price,Edmund,386,600,i am rather surprised that mr crawford should come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven weeks for i had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone to take him elsewhere he is used to much gayer places than mansfield,this is the first october that she has passed in the country since her infancy i do not call tunbridge or cheltenham the country and november is a still more serious month and i can see that mrs grant is very anxious for her not finding mansfield dull as winter comes on,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01408,Fanny Price,Edmund,388,57,what a favourite he is with my cousins,i must say it and say it with pleasure mrs norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01409,Fanny Price,Edmund,390,181,if miss bertram were not engaged i could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than julia,ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt s memory which misleads her here she is awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs crawford without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements though the admiral s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely i do not censure her opinions but there certainly is impropriety in making them public,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01410,Fanny Price,Edmund,435,942,perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them your brother s taste and your sisters seem very different,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01411,Fanny Price,Edmund,437,438,i should think my aunt norris would be on your side,i dare say she would but she has no influence with either tom or my sisters that could be of any use and if i cannot convince them myself i shall let things take their course without attempting it through her family squabbling is the greatest evil of all and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01412,Fanny Price,Edmund,507,16,come in,and when shall you do it,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
01413,Fanny Price,Edmund,509,940,yes certainly,yes she laments it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you fanny you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and esteems you with all her heart,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01414,Fanny Price,Edmund,511,753,my opinion,my dear fanny you feel these things a great deal too much i am most happy that you like the chain and that it should be here in time for to morrow but your thanks are far beyond the occasion believe me i have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours no i can safely say i have no pleasure so complete so unalloyed it is without a drawback but what is it that you want to consult me about return the necklace no my dear fanny upon no account it would be mortifying her severely there can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01415,Fanny Price,Edmund,513,948,yes but what can be done your brother is so determined,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01416,Fanny Price,Edmund,515,61,no not immediately but,and i am quite convinced that your being with mrs norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health and as much for your ultimate happiness too,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01417,Fanny Price,Edmund,517,922,i am sorry for miss crawford but i am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle it will be such a triumph to the others,never fanny so very determined and positive this is not like yourself your rational self,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01418,Fanny Price,Edmund,519,145,yes it will be a great point,have you never been there no you never can and unluckily it is out of distance for a ride i wish we could contrive it,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01419,Fanny Price,Edmund,521,245,no i cannot think of anything else,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01420,Fanny Price,Edmund,523,522,oh cousin,give me your approbation then fanny i am not comfortable without it,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01421,Fanny Price,Edmund,525,45,no doubt she will be very glad it must be a great relief to her,well fanny and if the plan were not unpleasant to you i should call it an excellent one,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01422,Fanny Price,Edmund,527,381,she was very kind indeed and i am glad to have her spared,i had a very apt scholar there s arcturus looking very bright,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
01423,Fanny Price,Edmund,589,520,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home,but still it has not your approbation can you mention any other measure by which i have a chance of doing equal good,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01424,Fanny Price,Edmund,591,924,i suppose i am graver than other people the evenings do not appear long to me i love to hear my uncle talk of the west indies i could listen to him for an hour together it entertains me more than many other things have done but then i am unlike other people i dare say,i must hope better things i am aware more aware than crawford can be that the man who means to make you love him you having due notice of his intentions must have very uphill work for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate which so many years growth have confirmed and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation i know that the apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for a time be arming you against him i wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do fanny between us i think we should have won you my theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as i firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01425,Fanny Price,Edmund,593,518,oh don t talk so don t talk so,they will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously i act but however triumph there certainly will be and i must brave it but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business of limiting the exhibition of concentrating our folly i shall be well repaid as i am now i have no influence i can do nothing i have offended them and they will not hear me but when i have put them in good humour by this concession i am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for this will be a material gain my object is to confine it to mrs rushworth and the grants will not this be worth gaining,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01426,Fanny Price,Edmund,595,143,but i do talk to him more than i used i am sure i do did not you hear me ask him about the slave trade last night,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
01427,Fanny Price,Edmund,597,938,and i longed to do it but there was such a dead silence and while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word or seeming at all interested in the subject i did not like i thought it would appear as if i wanted to set myself off at their expense by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel,yes when i reached the house i found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you fanny till crawford and dr grant came in,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
01428,Fanny Price,Edmund,599,177,she must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you to have any such apprehension and sir thomas s wishing just at first to be only with his family is so very natural that she can argue nothing from that after a little while i dare say we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way allowing for the difference of the time of year,it is her countenance that is so attractive she has a wonderful play of feature but was there nothing in her conversation that struck you fanny as not quite right,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

01431,Fanny Price,Edmund,673,53,the new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin s marriage i hope it is not too fine but i thought i ought to wear it as soon as i could and that i might not have such another opportunity all the winter i hope you do not think me too fine,as to your foolishness and awkwardness my dear fanny believe me you never have a shadow of either but in using the words so improperly there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known you have good sense and a sweet temper and i am sure you have a grateful heart that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

01434,Fanny Price,Edmund,754,14,if it had been given to me in the first instance i should not have thought of returning it but being her brother s present is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it when it is not wanted,but william will write to you i dare say,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

01436,Fanny Price,Edmund,760,516,no i have not been out at all,but what i see your judgment is not with me think it a little over perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief that may of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man s being received in this manner domesticated among us authorised to come at all hours and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints to think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create it is all very bad put yourself in miss crawford s place fanny consider what it would be to act amelia with a stranger she has a right to be felt for because she evidently feels for herself i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be it would be ungenerous it would be really wrong to expose her to it her feelings ought to be respected does it not strike you so fanny you hesitate,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01438,Fanny Price,Edmund,764,512,the effect of education,yes your advice and opinion i do not know what to do this acting scheme gets worse and worse you see they have chosen almost as bad a play as they could and now to complete the business are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us this is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first i know no harm of charles maddox but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable the more than intimacy the familiarity i cannot think of it with any patience and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must if possible be prevented do not you see it in the same light,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01439,Fanny Price,Edmund,766,389,if you only want me as a listener cousin i will be as useful as i can but i am not qualified for an adviser do not ask advice of me i am not competent,yes his manners to women are such as must please mrs grant i believe suspects him of a preference for julia i have never seen much symptom of it but i wish it may be so he has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01442,Fanny Price,Edmund,915,47,i am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what i feel,it has everything else in its favour my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you she is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought and i am glad her love of money does not interfere you will be what you ought to be to her i hope it does not distress you very much fanny,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01443,Fanny Price,Edmund,917,528,oh no but i thought you blamed me i thought you were against me this is such a comfort,i shall walk down immediately after breakfast and am sure of giving pleasure there and now dear fanny i will not interrupt you any longer you want to be reading but i could not be easy till i had spoken to you and come to a decision sleeping or waking my head has been full of this matter all night it is an evil but i am certainly making it less than it might be if tom is up i shall go to him directly and get it over and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity you in the meanwhile will be taking a trip into china i suppose how does lord macartney go on and here are crabbe s tales and the idler at hand to relieve you if you tire of your great book i admire your little establishment exceedingly and as soon as i am gone you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting and sit comfortably down to your table but do not stay here to be cold,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01444,Fanny Price,Edmund,919,757,my uncle thought me wrong and i knew he had been talking to you,for one night fanny for only one night if it be a sacrifice i am sure you will upon consideration make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort miss crawford s attentions to you have been not more than you were justly entitled to i am the last person to think that could be but they have been invariable and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude though i know it could never have the meaning is not in your nature i am sure wear the necklace as you are engaged to do to morrow evening and let the chain which was not ordered with any reference to the ball be kept for commoner occasions this is my advice i would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy i have been observing with the greatest pleasure and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences resulting principally from situation no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship i would not have the shadow of a coolness arise between the two dearest objects i have on earth,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01445,Fanny Price,Edmund,921,950,oh never never never he never will succeed with me,yes that is it was the fault of my own mind if i did not they were all very pleasant i doubt their finding me so i took uneasiness with me and there was no getting rid of it till i was in mansfield again,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01446,Fanny Price,Edmund,923,1019,i mean that i think i never shall as far as the future can be answered for i think i never shall return his regard,five and twenty minutes well she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them she spoke of it fanny with a steadier voice than i can said she i shall soon have done i have told you the substance of all that she said as soon as i could speak i replied that i had not supposed it possible coming in such a state of mind into that house as i had done that anything could occur to make me suffer more but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence that though i had in the course of our acquaintance been often sensible of some difference in our opinions on points too of some moment it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it that the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister with whom lay the greater seduction i pretended not to say but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself giving it every reproach but the right considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong and last of all and above all recommending to us a compliance a compromise an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin on the chance of a marriage which thinking as i now thought of her brother should rather be prevented than sought all this together most grievously convinced me that i had never understood her before and that as far as related to mind it had been the creature of my own imagination not miss crawford that i had been too apt to dwell on for many months past that perhaps it was best for me i had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship feelings hopes which must at any rate have been torn from me now and yet that i must and would confess that could i have restored her to what she had appeared to me before i would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem this is what i said the purport of it but as you may imagine not spoken so collectedly or methodically as i have repeated it to you she was astonished exceedingly astonished more than astonished i saw her change countenance she turned extremely red i imagined i saw a mixture of many feelings a great though short struggle half a wish of yielding to truths half a sense of shame but habit habit carried it she would have laughed if she could it was a sort of laugh as she answered,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01447,Fanny Price,Edmund,925,510,we are so totally unlike we are so very very different in all our inclinations and ways that i consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together even if i could like him there never were two people more dissimilar we have not one taste in common we should be miserable,i want to consult i want your opinion,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
01448,Fanny Price,Edmund,927,18,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over,if that be all your difficulty i will furnish you with paper and every other material and you may write your letter whenever you choose would it make you happy to write to william,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01449,Fanny Price,Edmund,929,914,as a bystander perhaps i saw more than you did and i do think that mr rushworth was sometimes very jealous,not of facts perhaps but of feelings fanny no one but you can tell me them i do not mean to press you however if it is not what you wish yourself i have done i had thought it might be a relief,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01450,Fanny Price,Edmund,931,602,before the play i am much mistaken if julia did not think he was paying her attentions,that is impossible fanny he must like him less after to morrow s visit for we shall be five hours in his company i should dread the stupidity of the day if there were not a much greater evil to follow the impression it must leave on sir thomas he cannot much longer deceive himself i am sorry for them all and would give something that rushworth and maria had never met,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01451,Fanny Price,Edmund,933,590,i am persuaded that he does not think as he ought on serious subjects,i believe you are right fanny i believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were than assuming a new character the novelty was in their being lively yet how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give i have been feeling as if we had never lived so before,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01452,Fanny Price,Edmund,935,916,i would not engage in such a charge in such an office of high responsibility,do you suppose that we think differently i have no idea of it i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be to the point i consider crawford s proposals as most advantageous and desirable if you could return his affection i consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it but that as you cannot you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him can there be any disagreement between us here,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01453,Fanny Price,Edmund,937,436,was mrs grant in the room then,i have no hope there fanny if they persist in the scheme they will find something i shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them and that is all i can do,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01454,Fanny Price,Edmund,939,936,it is above a week since i saw miss crawford,as usual believing yourself unequal to anything fancying everything too much for you well though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sincerely anxious that you may i have no common interest in crawford s well doing next to your happiness fanny his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in crawford i was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you fanny just as she ought she desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it i should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01456,Fanny Price,Edmund,943,524,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time,if you are against me i ought to distrust myself and yet but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act no matter whom the look of a gentleman is to be enough i thought you would have entered more into miss crawford s feelings,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01457,Fanny Price,Edmund,945,385,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply,yes i do not know how it has happened we will stay till this is finished fanny,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01458,Fanny Price,Edmund,947,926,you were near staying there,you are mistaken fanny the dissimilarity is not so strong you are quite enough alike you have tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in common you have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions you forget yourself there is a decided difference in your tempers i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheerfulness will counteract this he sees difficulties nowhere and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike fanny does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together do not imagine it i am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination for much or little company in the propensity to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i exclude extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme a counteraction gentle and continual is the best safeguard of manners and conduct,Edmund,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01525,Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,683,834,i believe you are right it was more pleasant than prudent we were getting too noisy,henry i think so highly of fanny price that if i could suppose the next mrs crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill used aunt had to abhor the very name i would prevent the marriage if possible but i know you i know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women and that even when you ceased to love she would yet find in you the liberality and good breeding of a gentleman,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01526,Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,685,696,the most interesting in the world how to make money how to turn a good income into a better dr grant is giving bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon i find he takes orders in a few weeks they were at it in the dining parlour i am glad to hear bertram will be so well off he will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with and earned without much trouble i apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother and as of course he will still live at home it will be all for his menus plaisirs and a sermon at christmas and easter i suppose will be the sum total of sacrifice,phoo phoo this is only because there were no tall women to compare her with and because she has got a new gown and you never saw her so well dressed before she is just what she was in october believe me the truth is that she was the only girl in company for you to notice and you must have a somebody i have always thought her pretty not strikingly pretty but pretty enough as people say a sort of beauty that grows on one her eyes should be darker but she has a sweet smile but as for this wonderful degree of improvement i am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress and your having nobody else to look at and therefore if you do set about a flirtation with her you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01527,Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,691,824,and how do you think i mean to amuse myself mary on the days that i do not hunt i am grown too old to go out more than three times a week but i have a plan for the intermediate days and what do you think it is,oh no you cannot were you even less pleasing supposing her not to love you already of which however i can have little doubt you would be safe the gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love that is if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition i can suppose it her but ask her to love you and she will never have the heart to refuse,Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01528,Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,693,698,not exactly though i shall be happy to do both but that would be exercise only to my body and i must take care of my mind besides that would be all recreation and indulgence without the wholesome alloy of labour and i do not like to eat the bread of idleness no my plan is to make fanny price in love with me,foolish fellow and so this is her attraction after all this it is her not caring about you which gives her such a soft skin and makes her so much taller and produces all these charms and graces i do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy a little love perhaps may animate and do her good but i will not have you plunge her deep for she is as good a little creature as ever lived and has a great deal of feeling,Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01529,Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,695,87,but i cannot be satisfied without fanny price without making a small hole in fanny price s heart you do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice when we talked of her last night you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks you see her every day and therefore do not notice it but i assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn she was then merely a quiet modest not plain looking girl but she is now absolutely pretty i used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance but in that soft skin of hers so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday there is decided beauty and from what i observed of her eyes and mouth i do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express and then her air her manner her tout ensemble is so indescribably improved she must be grown two inches at least since october,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him,Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

01533,Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,819,820,when fanny is known to him he will doat on her she is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the admiral for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world she is the very impossibility he would describe if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas but till it is absolutely settled settled beyond all interference he shall know nothing of the matter no mary you are quite mistaken you have not discovered my business yet,well well i am satisfied i know now to whom it must relate and am in no hurry for the rest fanny price wonderful quite wonderful that mansfield should have done so much for that you should have found your fate in mansfield but you are quite right you could not have chosen better there is not a better girl in the world and you do not want for fortune and as to her connexions they are more than good the bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country she is niece to sir thomas bertram that will be enough for the world but go on go on tell me more what are your plans does she know her own happiness,Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01555,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,822,701,what are you waiting for,do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the commissioner s at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01556,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,824,720,oh no you cannot were you even less pleasing supposing her not to love you already of which however i can have little doubt you would be safe the gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love that is if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition i can suppose it her but ask her to love you and she will never have the heart to refuse,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01557,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,826,717,the more i think of it the more am i convinced that you are doing quite right and though i should never have selected fanny price as the girl most likely to attach you i am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed you will both find your good in it,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01558,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,828,829,ha settle in northamptonshire that is pleasant then we shall be all together,you must give us more than half your time i cannot admit mrs grant to have an equal claim with fanny and myself for we shall both have a right in you fanny will be so truly your sister,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
01559,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,832,695,that s right and in london of course a house of your own no longer with the admiral my dearest henry the advantage to you of getting away from the admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life you are not sensible of the gain for your regard for him has blinded you but in my estimation your marrying early may be the saving of you to have seen you grow like the admiral in word or deed look or gesture would have broken my heart,but i cannot be satisfied without fanny price without making a small hole in fanny price s heart you do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice when we talked of her last night you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks you see her every day and therefore do not notice it but i assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn she was then merely a quiet modest not plain looking girl but she is now absolutely pretty i used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance but in that soft skin of hers so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday there is decided beauty and from what i observed of her eyes and mouth i do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express and then her air her manner her tout ensemble is so indescribably improved she must be grown two inches at least since october,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01560,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,834,837,henry i think so highly of fanny price that if i could suppose the next mrs crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill used aunt had to abhor the very name i would prevent the marriage if possible but i know you i know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women and that even when you ceased to love she would yet find in you the liberality and good breeding of a gentleman,i care neither what they say nor what they feel they will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me that can attach a man of sense i wish the discovery may do them any good and they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be and i wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness they will be angry mrs rushworth will be very angry it will be a bitter pill to her that is like other bitter pills it will have two moments ill flavour and then be swallowed and forgotten for i am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women s though i was the object of them yes mary my fanny will feel a difference indeed a daily hourly difference in the behaviour of every being who approaches her and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that i am the doer of it that i am the person to give the consequence so justly her due now she is dependent helpless friendless neglected forgotten,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01561,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,836,679,my dearest henry how glad i am to see you so much in love it quite delights me but what will mrs rushworth and julia say,poor rushworth and his two and forty speeches nobody can ever forget them poor fellow i see him now his toil and his despair well i am much mistaken if his lovely maria will ever want him to make two and forty speeches to her she is too good for him much too good you were mr rushworth s best friend your kindness and patience can never be forgotten your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own he might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness but i may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party it is as a dream a pleasant dream i shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure there was such an interest such an animation such a spirit diffused everybody felt it we were all alive there was employment hope solicitude bustle for every hour of the day always some little objection some little doubt some little anxiety to be got over i never was happier,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01562,Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,838,819,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her,when fanny is known to him he will doat on her she is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the admiral for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world she is the very impossibility he would describe if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas but till it is absolutely settled settled beyond all interference he shall know nothing of the matter no mary you are quite mistaken you have not discovered my business yet,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01563,Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,90,93,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls,but do you really for miss bertram is in general thought the handsomest,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
01564,Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,92,97,oh yes i like julia best,and besides miss bertram is engaged remember that my dear brother her choice is made,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01565,Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,94,99,so i should suppose she has the advantage in every feature and i prefer her countenance but i like julia best miss bertram is certainly the handsomest and i have found her the most agreeable but i shall always like julia best because you order me,why as to that mr rushworth is a very good sort of young man and it is a great match for her,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01566,Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,96,91,do not i tell you that i like her best at first,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01567,Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,98,95,yes and i like her the better for it an engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged she is satisfied with herself her cares are over and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion all is safe with a lady engaged no harm can be done,i shall not talk to you henry but i know you will like her best at last,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
01568,Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,100,101,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart,mary how shall we manage him,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
01569,Mary Crawford,Edmund,112,251,i begin now to understand you all except miss price pray is she out or is she not i am puzzled she dined at the parsonage with the rest of you which seemed like being out and yet she says so little that i can hardly suppose she is,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom,Edmund; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01570,Mary Crawford,Edmund,123,265,that was bad indeed poor miss sneyd though i have no younger sister i feel for her to be neglected before one s time must be very vexatious but it was entirely the mother s fault miss augusta should have been with her governess such half and half doings never prosper but now i must be satisfied about miss price does she go to balls does she dine out every where as well as at my sister s,yes i shall take orders soon after my father s return probably at christmas,Edmund; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
01571,Mary Crawford,Edmund,147,350,i collect that sotherton is an old place and a place of some grandeur in any particular style of building,it will indeed after such an absence an absence not only long but including so many dangers,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
01572,Mary Crawford,Edmund,153,635,ay you have been brought up to it it was no part of my education and the only dose i ever had being administered by not the first favourite in the world has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances three years ago the admiral my honoured uncle bought a cottage at twickenham for us all to spend our summers in and my aunt and i went down to it quite in raptures but it being excessively pretty it was soon found necessary to be improved and for three months we were all dirt and confusion without a gravel walk to step on or a bench fit for use i would have everything as complete as possible in the country shrubberies and flower gardens and rustic seats innumerable but it must all be done without my care henry is different he loves to be doing mr bertram i have tidings of my harp at last i am assured that it is safe at northampton and there it has probably been these ten days in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary the truth is that our inquiries were too direct we sent a servant we went ourselves this will not do seventy miles from london but this morning we heard of it in the right way it was seen by some farmer and he told the miller and the miller told the butcher and the butcher s son in law left word at the shop,that is not much to the purpose now and as to my being in parliament i believe i must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on no miss crawford there are distinctions which i should be miserable if i thought myself without any chance absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining but they are of a different character,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01573,Mary Crawford,Edmund,155,280,i am to have it to morrow but how do you think it is to be conveyed not by a wagon or cart oh no nothing of that kind could be hired in the village i might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow,you are speaking of london i am speaking of the nation at large,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
01574,Mary Crawford,Edmund,157,113,i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible so i told my maid to speak for one directly and as i cannot look out of my dressing closet without seeing one farmyard nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another i thought it would be only ask and have and was rather grieved that i could not give the advantage to all guess my surprise when i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable most impossible thing in the world had offended all the farmers all the labourers all the hay in the parish as for dr grant s bailiff i believe i had better keep out of his way and my brother in law himself who is all kindness in general looked rather black upon me when he found what i had been at,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01575,Mary Crawford,Edmund,159,377,i shall understand all your ways in time but coming down with the true london maxim that everything is to be got with money i was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs however i am to have my harp fetched to morrow henry who is good nature itself has offered to fetch it in his barouche will it not be honourably conveyed i shall be most happy to play to you both at least as long as you can like to listen probably much longer for i dearly love music myself and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off for she is gratified in more ways than one now mr bertram if you write to your brother i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come he heard so much of my misery about it and you may say if you please that i shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return in compassion to his feelings as i know his horse will lose,there goes good humour i am sure there goes a temper which would never give pain how well she walks and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others joining them the moment she is asked what a pity that she should have been in such hands,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01576,Mary Crawford,Edmund,164,255,at sea has she in the king s service of course,the mind which does not struggle against itself under one circumstance would find objects to distract it in the other i believe and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with the greater length of the service however i admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind one wishes it were not so but i have not yet left oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01577,Mary Crawford,Edmund,166,307,among admirals large enough but we know very little of the inferior ranks post captains may be very good sort of men but they do not belong to us of various admirals i could tell you a great deal of them and their flags and the gradation of their pay and their bickerings and jealousies but in general i can assure you that they are all passed over and all very ill used certainly my home at my uncle s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals of rears and vices i saw enough now do not be suspecting me of a pun i entreat,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01578,Mary Crawford,Edmund,186,167,my dear miss price i am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting but i have nothing in the world to say for myself i knew it was very late and that i was behaving extremely ill and therefore if you please you must forgive me selfishness must always be forgiven you know because there is no hope of a cure,it is a noble profession,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
01579,Mary Crawford,Edmund,250,287,very fine indeed it must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure and say their prayers here twice a day while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away,go into the law with as much ease as i was told to go into this wilderness,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
01580,Mary Crawford,Edmund,252,631,at any rate it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects everybody likes to go their own way to chuse their own time and manner of devotion the obligation of attendance the formality the restraint the length of time altogether it is a formidable thing and what nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed when they woke with a headache without danger of reprobation because chapel was missed they would have jumped with joy and envy cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel the young mrs eleanors and mrs bridgets starched up into seeming piety but with heads full of something very different especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at and in those days i fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now,your degree of respect for honesty rich or poor is precisely what i have no manner of concern with i do not mean to be poor poverty is exactly what i have determined against honesty in the something between in the middle state of worldly circumstances is all that i am anxious for your not looking down on,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01581,Mary Crawford,Edmund,254,253,yes very likely they would have two chances at least in their favour there would be less to distract the attention from without and it would not be tried so long,your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects you have given us an amusing sketch and human nature cannot say it was not so we must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish but if you are supposing it a frequent thing that is to say a weakness grown into a habit from neglect what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons do you think the minds which are suffered which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel would be more collected in a closet,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01582,Mary Crawford,Edmund,264,486,ordained what are you to be a clergyman,my advice is that you change the play,Edmund; Fanny Price; Julia Bertram,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
01583,Mary Crawford,Edmund,271,158,this is insufferably hot shall any of us object to being comfortable here is a nice little wood if one can but get into it what happiness if the door should not be locked but of course it is for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like so you are to be a clergyman mr bertram this is rather a surprise to me,you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before but when you do think of it you must see the importance of getting in the grass the hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out but in harvest it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01584,Mary Crawford,Edmund,273,124,very true but in short it had not occurred to me and you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01585,Mary Crawford,Edmund,275,160,but why are you to be a clergyman i thought that was always the lot of the youngest where there were many to chuse before him,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
01586,Mary Crawford,Edmund,277,301,never is a black word but yes in the never of conversation which means not very often i do think it for what is to be done in the church men love to distinguish themselves and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained but not in the church a clergyman is nothing,i am afraid you are very tired fanny why would not you speak sooner this will be a bad day s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon miss crawford except riding,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01587,Mary Crawford,Edmund,279,627,you assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given or than i can quite comprehend one does not see much of this influence and importance in society and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves how can two sermons a week even supposing them worth hearing supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer blair s to his own do all that you speak of govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit,you intend to be very rich,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
01588,Mary Crawford,Edmund,281,295,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest,not half a mile,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
01589,Mary Crawford,Edmund,284,354,there you have quite convinced miss price already,there is no sacrifice in the case it is entirely her own doing,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
01590,Mary Crawford,Edmund,286,274,i do not think you ever will i am just as much surprised now as i was at first that you should intend to take orders you really are fit for something better come do change your mind it is not too late go into the law,a very praiseworthy practice but not quite universal i am one of the exceptions and being one must do something for myself,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01591,Mary Crawford,Edmund,288,365,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you,shall i ask you how the church is to be filled if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without no for you certainly would not know what to say but i must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument as he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession as heroism and noise and fashion are all against him he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01592,Mary Crawford,Edmund,292,299,thank you but i am not at all tired,we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here do you think we are walking four miles an hour,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
01593,Mary Crawford,Edmund,294,165,i am really not tired which i almost wonder at for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood do not you think we have,do you know anything of my cousin s captain captain marshall you have a large acquaintance in the navy i conclude,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
01594,Mary Crawford,Edmund,296,285,oh you do not consider how much we have wound about we have taken such a very serpentine course and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path,i wish i could convince miss crawford too,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
01595,Mary Crawford,Edmund,298,633,oh i know nothing of your furlongs but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it and therefore when i say that we have walked a mile in it i must speak within compass,but how may it rise how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01596,Mary Crawford,Edmund,300,154,oh do not attack me with your watch a watch is always too fast or too slow i cannot be dictated to by a watch,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01597,Mary Crawford,Edmund,302,293,how abominable in you then to let me engross her horse as i did all last week i am ashamed of you and of myself but it shall never happen again,you scarcely touch me you do not make me of any use what a difference in the weight of a woman s arm from that of a man at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only a fly in the comparison,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01598,Mary Crawford,Edmund,306,617,i must move resting fatigues me i have looked across the ha ha till i am weary i must go and look through that iron gate at the same view without being able to see it so well,perhaps i might have scolded if either of you had been sitting down alone but while you do wrong together i can overlook a great deal,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
01599,Mary Crawford,Edmund,349,156,how happy mr rushworth looks he is thinking of november your father s return will be a very interesting event,you would find it difficult i dare say just now in the middle of a very late hay harvest to hire a horse and cart,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01600,Mary Crawford,Edmund,353,276,don t be affronted but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes who after performing great exploits in a foreign land offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return,do you think the church itself never chosen then,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
01601,Mary Crawford,Edmund,355,367,oh yes i know it is i was merely joking she has done no more than what every young woman would do and i have no doubt of her being extremely happy my other sacrifice of course you do not understand,there are such clergymen no doubt but i think they are not so common as to justify miss crawford in esteeming it their general character i suspect that in this comprehensive and may i say commonplace censure you are not judging from yourself but from prejudiced persons whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing it is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy you can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively you are speaking what you have been told at your uncle s table,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01602,Mary Crawford,Edmund,357,272,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01603,Mary Crawford,Edmund,362,488,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors,that circumstance would by no means tempt me for i should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting it must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing a formal solemn lecturer and the man who chuses the profession itself is perhaps one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01604,Mary Crawford,Edmund,364,297,what take orders without a living no that is madness indeed absolute madness,but if you remember before we left that first great path we saw directly to the end of it we looked down the whole vista and saw it closed by iron gates and it could not have been more than a furlong in length,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
01605,Mary Crawford,Edmund,366,369,oh no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made to the trouble of working for one and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat drink and grow fat it is indolence mr bertram indeed indolence and love of ease a want of all laudable ambition of taste for good company or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable which make men clergymen a clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish read the newspaper watch the weather and quarrel with his wife his curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01606,Mary Crawford,Edmund,368,375,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
01607,Mary Crawford,Edmund,371,187,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it,for there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner clouds are now coming up and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then i wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise i wish you had saved yourself this walk home,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01608,Mary Crawford,Edmund,374,356,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night,my taking orders i assure you is quite as voluntary as maria s marrying,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
01609,Mary Crawford,Edmund,376,358,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it,which you suppose has biassed me,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
01610,Mary Crawford,Edmund,485,289,they do not want me at all i only puzzle them and oblige them to make civil speeches mr edmund bertram as you do not act yourself you will be a disinterested adviser and therefore i apply to you what shall we do for an anhalt is it practicable for any of the others to double it what is your advice,you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot for there is not the least wit in my nature i am a very matter of fact plain spoken being and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out,Edmund; Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Mrs. Norris,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01611,Mary Crawford,Edmund,487,282,i should have no objection for though i should not particularly dislike the part of amelia if well supported that is if everything went well i shall be sorry to be an inconvenience but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table it certainly will not be taken if any part could tempt you to act i suppose it would be anhalt for he is a clergyman you know,not i should hope of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom we do not look in great cities for our best morality it is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt a fine preacher is followed and admired but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character and observing his general conduct which in london can rarely be the case the clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners they are known to the largest part only as preachers and with regard to their influencing public manners miss crawford must not misunderstand me or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulators of refinement and courtesy the masters of the ceremonies of life the manners i speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps the result of good principles the effect in short of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i believe be everywhere found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to be so are the rest of the nation,Edmund; Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Mrs. Norris,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01612,Mary Crawford,Edmund,616,278,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again,the nothing of conversation has its gradations i hope as well as the never a clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion he must not head mobs or set the ton in dress but i cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind individually or collectively considered temporally and eternally which has the guardianship of religion and morals and consequently of the manners which result from their influence no one here can call the office nothing if the man who holds it is so it is by the neglect of his duty by foregoing its just importance and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear,Edmund; Fanny Price; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01613,Mary Crawford,Edmund,626,372,i mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of it certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant,Edmund; Fanny Price; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01614,Mary Crawford,Edmund,628,363,to be sure do not you do not we all,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision,Edmund; Fanny Price; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01615,Mary Crawford,Edmund,630,303,by moderation and economy and bringing down your wants to your income and all that i understand you and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life with such limited means and indifferent connexions what can you want but a decent maintenance you have not much time before you and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence be honest and poor by all means but i shall not envy you i do not much think i shall even respect you i have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me,Edmund; Fanny Price; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
01616,Mary Crawford,Edmund,632,148,but i do look down upon it if it might have been higher i must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well,Edmund; Fanny Price; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01617,Mary Crawford,Edmund,634,629,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago,i cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command miss crawford may chuse her degree of wealth she has only to fix on her number of thousands a year and there can be no doubt of their coming my intentions are only not to be poor,Edmund; Fanny Price; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01618,Edmund,Mary Crawford,113,161,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me,no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the fewest possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be who loves me consults me confides in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and everything as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style that is a complete brother s letter,Mary Crawford; Tom Bertram,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01619,Edmund,Mary Crawford,120,168,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards,yes the profession is well enough under two circumstances if it make the fortune and there be discretion in spending it but in short it is not a favourite profession of mine it has never worn an amiable form to me,Mary Crawford; Tom Bertram,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01620,Edmund,Mary Crawford,124,300,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her,oh do not attack me with your watch a watch is always too fast or too slow i cannot be dictated to by a watch,Mary Crawford; Tom Bertram,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
01621,Edmund,Mary Crawford,148,308,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well,it is an immense distance i see that with a glance,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
01622,Edmund,Mary Crawford,150,277,i do not wish to influence mr rushworth but had i a place to new fashion i should not put myself into the hands of an improver i would rather have an inferior degree of beauty of my own choice and acquired progressively i would rather abide by my own blunders than by his,never is a black word but yes in the never of conversation which means not very often i do think it for what is to be done in the church men love to distinguish themselves and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained but not in the church a clergyman is nothing,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01623,Edmund,Mary Crawford,154,252,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay,at any rate it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects everybody likes to go their own way to chuse their own time and manner of devotion the obligation of attendance the formality the restraint the length of time altogether it is a formidable thing and what nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed when they woke with a headache without danger of reprobation because chapel was missed they would have jumped with joy and envy cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel the young mrs eleanors and mrs bridgets starched up into seeming piety but with heads full of something very different especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at and in those days i fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01624,Edmund,Mary Crawford,156,294,you would find it difficult i dare say just now in the middle of a very late hay harvest to hire a horse and cart,i am really not tired which i almost wonder at for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood do not you think we have,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
01625,Edmund,Mary Crawford,158,166,you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before but when you do think of it you must see the importance of getting in the grass the hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out but in harvest it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse,among admirals large enough but we know very little of the inferior ranks post captains may be very good sort of men but they do not belong to us of various admirals i could tell you a great deal of them and their flags and the gradation of their pay and their bickerings and jealousies but in general i can assure you that they are all passed over and all very ill used certainly my home at my uncle s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals of rears and vices i saw enough now do not be suspecting me of a pun i entreat,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01626,Edmund,Mary Crawford,160,155,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing,i am to have it to morrow but how do you think it is to be conveyed not by a wagon or cart oh no nothing of that kind could be hired in the village i might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01627,Edmund,Mary Crawford,163,121,miss price has a brother at sea whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01628,Edmund,Mary Crawford,165,157,do you know anything of my cousin s captain captain marshall you have a large acquaintance in the navy i conclude,i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible so i told my maid to speak for one directly and as i cannot look out of my dressing closet without seeing one farmyard nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another i thought it would be only ask and have and was rather grieved that i could not give the advantage to all guess my surprise when i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable most impossible thing in the world had offended all the farmers all the labourers all the hay in the parish as for dr grant s bailiff i believe i had better keep out of his way and my brother in law himself who is all kindness in general looked rather black upon me when he found what i had been at,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01630,Edmund,Mary Crawford,187,188,for there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner clouds are now coming up and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then i wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise i wish you had saved yourself this walk home,no part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse i assure you i am very strong nothing ever fatigues me but doing what i do not like miss price i give way to you with a very bad grace but i sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride and that i may have nothing but good to hear of this dear delightful beautiful animal,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01631,Edmund,Mary Crawford,251,630,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom,by moderation and economy and bringing down your wants to your income and all that i understand you and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life with such limited means and indifferent connexions what can you want but a decent maintenance you have not much time before you and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence be honest and poor by all means but i shall not envy you i do not much think i shall even respect you i have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01632,Edmund,Mary Crawford,253,366,your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects you have given us an amusing sketch and human nature cannot say it was not so we must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish but if you are supposing it a frequent thing that is to say a weakness grown into a habit from neglect what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons do you think the minds which are suffered which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel would be more collected in a closet,oh no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made to the trouble of working for one and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat drink and grow fat it is indolence mr bertram indeed indolence and love of ease a want of all laudable ambition of taste for good company or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable which make men clergymen a clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish read the newspaper watch the weather and quarrel with his wife his curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01633,Edmund,Mary Crawford,265,351,yes i shall take orders soon after my father s return probably at christmas,it will be the forerunner also of other interesting events your sister s marriage and your taking orders,Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01634,Edmund,Mary Crawford,272,298,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor,oh i know nothing of your furlongs but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it and therefore when i say that we have walked a mile in it i must speak within compass,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01635,Edmund,Mary Crawford,274,266,a very praiseworthy practice but not quite universal i am one of the exceptions and being one must do something for myself,if i had known this before i would have spoken of the cloth with more respect,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
01636,Edmund,Mary Crawford,276,286,do you think the church itself never chosen then,i do not think you ever will i am just as much surprised now as i was at first that you should intend to take orders you really are fit for something better come do change your mind it is not too late go into the law,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01637,Edmund,Mary Crawford,278,159,the nothing of conversation has its gradations i hope as well as the never a clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion he must not head mobs or set the ton in dress but i cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind individually or collectively considered temporally and eternally which has the guardianship of religion and morals and consequently of the manners which result from their influence no one here can call the office nothing if the man who holds it is so it is by the neglect of his duty by foregoing its just importance and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear,i shall understand all your ways in time but coming down with the true london maxim that everything is to be got with money i was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs however i am to have my harp fetched to morrow henry who is good nature itself has offered to fetch it in his barouche will it not be honourably conveyed i shall be most happy to play to you both at least as long as you can like to listen probably much longer for i dearly love music myself and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off for she is gratified in more ways than one now mr bertram if you write to your brother i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come he heard so much of my misery about it and you may say if you please that i shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return in compassion to his feelings as i know his horse will lose,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01638,Edmund,Mary Crawford,280,281,you are speaking of london i am speaking of the nation at large,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
01639,Edmund,Mary Crawford,285,716,i wish i could convince miss crawford too,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01640,Edmund,Mary Crawford,287,149,go into the law with as much ease as i was told to go into this wilderness,he is a well bred man he makes the best of it,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
01641,Edmund,Mary Crawford,291,292,my dear fanny how thoughtless i have been i hope you are not very tired perhaps my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm,thank you but i am not at all tired,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
01642,Edmund,Mary Crawford,293,628,you scarcely touch me you do not make me of any use what a difference in the weight of a woman s arm from that of a man at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only a fly in the comparison,to be sure do not you do not we all,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
01643,Edmund,Mary Crawford,295,634,not half a mile,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
01644,Edmund,Mary Crawford,297,273,but if you remember before we left that first great path we saw directly to the end of it we looked down the whole vista and saw it closed by iron gates and it could not have been more than a furlong in length,very true but in short it had not occurred to me and you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01645,Edmund,Mary Crawford,299,114,we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here do you think we are walking four miles an hour,and yet in general nothing can be more easily ascertained the distinction is so broad manners as well as appearance are generally speaking so totally different till now i could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl s being out or not a girl not out has always the same sort of dress a close bonnet for instance looks very demure and never says a word you may smile but it is so i assure you and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far it is all very proper girls should be quiet and modest the most objectionable part is that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden they sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite to confidence that is the faulty part of the present system one does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before mr bertram i dare say you have sometimes met with such changes,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01646,Edmund,Mary Crawford,301,151,i am afraid you are very tired fanny why would not you speak sooner this will be a bad day s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon miss crawford except riding,you would know what you were about of course but that would not suit me i have no eye or ingenuity for such matters but as they are before me and had i a place of my own in the country i should be most thankful to any mr repton who would undertake it and give me as much beauty as he could for my money and i should never look at it till it was complete,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01647,Edmund,Mary Crawford,303,304,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me,that she should be tired now however gives me no surprise for there is nothing in the course of one s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning seeing a great house dawdling from one room to another straining one s eyes and one s attention hearing what one does not understand admiring what one does not care for it is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world and miss price has found it so though she did not know it,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01648,Edmund,Mary Crawford,307,254,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile,yes very likely they would have two chances at least in their favour there would be less to distract the attention from without and it would not be tried so long,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01649,Edmund,Mary Crawford,350,620,it will indeed after such an absence an absence not only long but including so many dangers,upon my word you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends i ever met with there is no giving you a moment s uneasiness you do not know how much we have been suffering nor what chills we have felt but i have long thought mr bertram one of the worst subjects to work on in any little manoeuvre against common sense that a woman could be plagued with i had very little hope of him from the first but you mrs grant my sister my own sister i think i had a right to alarm you a little,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01650,Edmund,Mary Crawford,354,296,there is no sacrifice in the case it is entirely her own doing,oh you do not consider how much we have wound about we have taken such a very serpentine course and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01651,Edmund,Mary Crawford,356,632,my taking orders i assure you is quite as voluntary as maria s marrying,but i do look down upon it if it might have been higher i must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01652,Edmund,Mary Crawford,363,368,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01653,Edmund,Mary Crawford,365,164,shall i ask you how the church is to be filled if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without no for you certainly would not know what to say but i must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument as he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession as heroism and noise and fashion are all against him he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his,at sea has she in the king s service of course,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
01654,Edmund,Mary Crawford,367,355,there are such clergymen no doubt but i think they are not so common as to justify miss crawford in esteeming it their general character i suspect that in this comprehensive and may i say commonplace censure you are not judging from yourself but from prejudiced persons whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing it is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy you can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively you are speaking what you have been told at your uncle s table,oh yes i know it is i was merely joking she has done no more than what every young woman would do and i have no doubt of her being extremely happy my other sacrifice of course you do not understand,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01655,Edmund,Mary Crawford,375,357,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01656,Edmund,Mary Crawford,486,288,my advice is that you change the play,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you,Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Norris,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01657,Edmund,Mary Crawford,619,279,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may,you assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given or than i can quite comprehend one does not see much of this influence and importance in society and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves how can two sermons a week even supposing them worth hearing supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer blair s to his own do all that you speak of govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01658,Edmund,Mary Crawford,627,275,you intend to be very rich,but why are you to be a clergyman i thought that was always the lot of the youngest where there were many to chuse before him,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
01659,Edmund,Mary Crawford,629,487,i cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command miss crawford may chuse her degree of wealth she has only to fix on her number of thousands a year and there can be no doubt of their coming my intentions are only not to be poor,i should have no objection for though i should not particularly dislike the part of amelia if well supported that is if everything went well i shall be sorry to be an inconvenience but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table it certainly will not be taken if any part could tempt you to act i suppose it would be anhalt for he is a clergyman you know,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01660,Edmund,Mary Crawford,631,364,your degree of respect for honesty rich or poor is precisely what i have no manner of concern with i do not mean to be poor poverty is exactly what i have determined against honesty in the something between in the middle state of worldly circumstances is all that i am anxious for your not looking down on,what take orders without a living no that is madness indeed absolute madness,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0
01661,Edmund,Mary Crawford,633,302,but how may it rise how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction,how abominable in you then to let me engross her horse as i did all last week i am ashamed of you and of myself but it shall never happen again,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01662,Edmund,Mary Crawford,715,125,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me,oh then the point is clear miss price is not out,Dr. Grant; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; William Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
01663,Edmund,Mary Crawford,718,719,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told,Dr. Grant; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; William Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01665,Mary Crawford,Tom Bertram,116,122,no indeed miss anderson i do not know who or what you mean i am quite in the dark but i will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me,Edmund; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01666,Mary Crawford,Tom Bertram,118,482,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong,i should be but too happy in taking the part if it were possible but unluckily the butler and anhalt are in together i will not entirely give it up however i will try what can be done i will look it over again,Edmund; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01667,Mary Crawford,Tom Bertram,121,115,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson,Edmund; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
01668,Mary Crawford,Tom Bertram,481,119,i am not at all surprised at this want of an anhalt amelia deserves no better such a forward young lady may well frighten the men,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right,Henry Crawford; Maria Bertram; Mr. Rushworth; Mr. Yates; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

01670,Tom Bertram,Mary Crawford,117,116,ah you carry it off very well but i cannot be quite so far imposed on you must have had miss anderson in your eye in describing an altered young lady you paint too accurately for mistake it was exactly so the andersons of baker street we were speaking of them the other day you know edmund you have heard me mention charles anderson the circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it when anderson first introduced me to his family about two years ago his sister was not out and i could not get her to speak to me i sat there an hour one morning waiting for anderson with only her and a little girl or two in the room the governess being sick or run away and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business and i could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady nothing like a civil answer she screwed up her mouth and turned from me with such an air i did not see her again for a twelvemonth she was then out i met her at mrs holford s and did not recollect her she came up to me claimed me as an acquaintance stared me out of countenance and talked and laughed till i did not know which way to look i felt that i must be the jest of the room at the time and miss crawford it is plain has heard the story,no indeed miss anderson i do not know who or what you mean i am quite in the dark but i will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about,Edmund; Mary Crawford,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
01671,Tom Bertram,Mary Crawford,122,118,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong,Edmund; Mary Crawford,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01672,Tom Bertram,Mary Crawford,503,123,but there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it we have but to speak the word we may pick and chuse i could name at this moment at least six young men within six miles of us who are wild to be admitted into our company and there are one or two that would not disgrace us i should not be afraid to trust either of the olivers or charles maddox tom oliver is a very clever fellow and charles maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere so i will take my horse early to morrow morning and ride over to stoke and settle with one of them,that was bad indeed poor miss sneyd though i have no younger sister i feel for her to be neglected before one s time must be very vexatious but it was entirely the mother s fault miss augusta should have been with her governess such half and half doings never prosper but now i must be satisfied about miss price does she go to balls does she dine out every where as well as at my sister s,Edmund; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mr. Rushworth; Mr. Yates; Mrs. Norris,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01705,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,506,958,i am not very sanguine as to our play and i can tell mr maddox that i shall shorten some of his speeches and a great many of my own before we rehearse together it will be very disagreeable and by no means what i expected,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01706,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,547,614,am i right yes this is the east room my dear miss price i beg your pardon but i have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help thank you i am quite warm very warm allow me to stay here a little while and do have the goodness to hear me my third act i have brought my book and if you would but rehearse it with me i should be so obliged i came here to day intending to rehearse it with edmund by ourselves against the evening but he is not in the way and if he were i do not think i could go through it with him till i have hardened myself a little for really there is a speech or two you will be so good won t you have you ever happened to look at the part i mean here it is i did not think much of it at first but upon my word there look at that speech and that and that how am i ever to look him in the face and say such things could you do it but then he is your cousin which makes all the difference you must rehearse it with me that i may fancy you him and get on by degrees you have a look of his sometimes,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01711,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,611,507,i should have thought so theoretically myself but take it all and all i never spent so happy a summer but then there is no saying what it may lead to i am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than i had ever expected to be i can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country under certain circumstances very pleasant an elegant moderate sized house in the centre of family connexions continual engagements among them commanding the first society in the neighbourhood looked up to perhaps as leading it even more than those of larger fortune and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a t te t te with the person one feels most agreeable in the world there is nothing frightful in such a picture is there miss price one need not envy the new mrs rushworth with such a home as that,come in,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

01719,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,807,152,that is the first question you know which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another but it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies about any three sisters just grown up for one knows without being told exactly what they are all very accomplished and pleasing and one very pretty there is a beauty in every family it is a regular thing two play on the pianoforte and one on the harp and all sing or would sing if they were taught or sing all the better for not being taught or something like it,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

01723,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,953,806,i must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere sad sad girl i do not know when i shall have done scolding you ha am i here again the east room once only was i in this room before once only before do you remember it i came to rehearse your cousin came too and we had a rehearsal you were our audience and prompter a delightful rehearsal i shall never forget it here we were just in this part of the room here was your cousin here was i here were the chairs oh why will such things ever pass away the scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable the subject of it so very very what shall i say he was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me i think i see him now trying to be as demure and composed as anhalt ought through the two long speeches when two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state matrimony may be called a happy life i suppose no time can ever wear out the impression i have of his looks and voice as he said those words it was curious very curious that we should have such a scene to play if i had the power of recalling any one week of my existence it should be that week that acting week say what you would fanny it should be that for i never knew such exquisite happiness in any other his sturdy spirit to bend as it did oh it was sweet beyond expression but alas that very evening destroyed it all that very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle poor sir thomas who was glad to see you yet fanny do not imagine i would now speak disrespectfully of sir thomas though i certainly did hate him for many a week no i do him justice now he is just what the head of such a family should be nay in sober sadness i believe i now love you all i have had a little fit since i came into this room as you may perceive but it is over now so let us sit down and be comfortable for as to scolding you fanny which i came fully intending to do i have not the heart for it when it comes to the point good gentle fanny when i think of this being the last time of seeing you for i do not know how long i feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you i hate to leave you i shall see no one half so amiable where i am going who says we shall not be sisters i know we shall i feel that we are born to be connected and those tears convince me that you feel it too dear fanny,i do not at all know i never heard,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
01724,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,955,604,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it perfectly,but they are passed over i have been watching them this weather is all from the south,Fanny

01725,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,957,960,knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes,i cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman s feelings and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander by can judge of,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
01726,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,959,249,ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad flirt and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies affections i have often scolded him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for and then fanny the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1
01727,Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,961,798,i do not defend him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at everingham i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never been addicted to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before that he loves you with all his heart and will love you as nearly for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman for ever i think henry will do as much for you i cannot imagine henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

01729,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,249,374,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01733,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,373,613,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman,ah here he is my sister and mr bertram i am so glad your eldest cousin is gone that he may be mr bertram again there is something in the sound of mr edmund bertram so formal so pitiful so younger brother like that i detest it,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

01736,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,606,615,this is pretty very pretty every time i come into this shrubbery i am more struck with its growth and beauty three years ago this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field never thought of as anything or capable of becoming anything and now it is converted into a walk and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament and perhaps in another three years we may be forgetting almost forgetting what it was before how wonderful how very wonderful the operations of time and the changes of the human mind if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences the memory is sometimes so retentive so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered and so weak and at others again so tyrannic so beyond control we are to be sure a miracle every way but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out it may seem impertinent in me to praise but i must admire the taste mrs grant has shewn in all this there is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk not too much attempted,i grant you the name is good in itself and lord edmund or sir edmund sound delightfully but sink it under the chill the annihilation of a mr and mr edmund is no more than mr john or mr thomas well shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year by being up before they can begin,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01737,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,608,963,i am so glad to see the evergreens thrive my uncle s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general the evergreen how beautiful how welcome how wonderful the evergreen when one thinks of it how astonishing a variety of nature in some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence you will think me rhapsodising but when i am out of doors especially when i am sitting out of doors i am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain one cannot fix one s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy,i know he must have exerted himself very much for i know the parties he had to move the admiral hates trouble and scorns asking favours and there are so many young men s claims to be attended to in the same way that a friendship and energy not very determined is easily put by what a happy creature william must be i wish we could see him i should like to sit talking with you here all day but we must not forget the ladies below and so good bye my dear my amiable my excellent fanny for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast parlour i must take leave of you here and i do take leave longing for a happy reunion and trusting that when we meet again it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve i shall see your cousin in town soon he talks of being there tolerably soon and sir thomas i dare say in the course of the spring and your eldest cousin and the rushworths and julia i am sure of meeting again and again and all but you i have two favours to ask fanny one is your correspondence you must write to me and the other that you will often call on mrs grant and make her amends for my being gone,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01740,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,614,803,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections,oh if he wrote to his father but i thought it might have been to lady bertram or you but if he wrote to his father no wonder he was concise who could write chat to sir thomas if he had written to you there would have been more particulars you would have heard of balls and parties he would have sent you a description of everything and everybody how many miss owens are there,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01741,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,747,807,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were,that is the first question you know which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another but it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies about any three sisters just grown up for one knows without being told exactly what they are all very accomplished and pleasing and one very pretty there is a beauty in every family it is a regular thing two play on the pianoforte and one on the harp and all sing or would sing if they were taught or sing all the better for not being taught or something like it,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01744,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,802,609,i only heard a part of the letter it was to my uncle but i believe it was very short indeed i am sure it was but a few lines all that i heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer and that he had agreed to do so a few days longer or some days longer i am not quite sure which,to say the truth i am something like the famous doge at the court of lewis xiv and may declare that i see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it if anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home that i should be spending month after month here as i have done i certainly should not have believed them i have now been here nearly five months and moreover the quietest five months i ever passed,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01746,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,806,955,i do not at all know i never heard,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you

01747,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,808,153,i know nothing of the miss owens,ay you have been brought up to it it was no part of my education and the only dose i ever had being administered by not the first favourite in the world has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances three years ago the admiral my honoured uncle bought a cottage at twickenham for us all to spend our summers in and my aunt and i went down to it quite in raptures but it being excessively pretty it was soon found necessary to be improved and for three months we were all dirt and confusion without a gravel walk to step on or a bench fit for use i would have everything as complete as possible in the country shrubberies and flower gardens and rustic seats innumerable but it must all be done without my care henry is different he loves to be doing mr bertram i have tidings of my harp at last i am assured that it is safe at northampton and there it has probably been these ten days in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary the truth is that our inquiries were too direct we sent a servant we went ourselves this will not do seventy miles from london but this morning we heard of it in the right way it was seen by some farmer and he told the miller and the miller told the butcher and the butcher s son in law left word at the shop,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01749,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,812,611,no i do not expect it at all,i should have thought so theoretically myself but take it all and all i never spent so happy a summer but then there is no saying what it may lead to i am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than i had ever expected to be i can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country under certain circumstances very pleasant an elegant moderate sized house in the centre of family connexions continual engagements among them commanding the first society in the neighbourhood looked up to perhaps as leading it even more than those of larger fortune and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a t te t te with the person one feels most agreeable in the world there is nothing frightful in such a picture is there miss price one need not envy the new mrs rushworth with such a home as that,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01752,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,956,549,do you mean then that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand oh miss crawford that was not fair,none of it i suppose you are to have the book of course now for it we must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage there very good school room chairs not made for a theatre i dare say much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson what would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose could sir thomas look in upon us just now he would bless himself for we are rehearsing all over the house yates is storming away in the dining room i heard him as i came upstairs and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers agatha and frederick if they are not perfect i shall be surprised by the bye i looked in upon them five minutes ago and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying not to embrace and mr rushworth was with me i thought he began to look a little queer so i turned it off as well as i could by whispering to him we shall have an excellent agatha there is something so maternal in her manner so completely maternal in her voice and countenance was not that well done of me he brightened up directly now for my soliloquy,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
01753,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,958,961,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing,i do not defend him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at everingham i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never been addicted to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before that he loves you with all his heart and will love you as nearly for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman for ever i think henry will do as much for you i cannot imagine henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

01755,Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,962,748,oh yes how very very kind of him,you must think of somebody else too when you wear that necklace you must think of henry for it was his choice in the first place he gave it to me and with the necklace i make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver it is to be a family remembrancer the sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too my dear child what are you afraid of do you think henry will claim the necklace as mine and fancy you did not come honestly by it or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago before he knew there was such a throat in the world or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire well then to convince me that you suspect no trick and are as unsuspicious of compliment as i have always found you take the necklace and say no more about it its being a gift of my brother s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it he is always giving me something or other i have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half and as for this necklace i do not suppose i have worn it six times it is very pretty but i never think of it and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

02000,Sir Thomas,Fanny Price,874,875,it is of no use i perceive to talk to you we had better put an end to this most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting i will therefore only add as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct that you have disappointed every expectation i had formed and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what i had supposed for i had fanny as i think my behaviour must have shewn formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to england i had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days even in young women and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence but you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse that you can and will decide for yourself without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you without even asking their advice you have shewn yourself very very different from anything that i had imagined the advantage or disadvantage of your family of your parents your brothers and sisters never seems to have had a moment s share in your thoughts on this occasion how they might be benefited how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you is nothing to you you think only of yourself and because you do not feel for mr crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness you resolve to refuse him at once without wishing even for a little time to consider of it a little more time for cool consideration and for really examining your own inclinations and are in a wild fit of folly throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled as will probably never occur to you again here is a young man of sense of character of temper of manners and of fortune exceedingly attached to you and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way and let me tell you fanny that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half mr crawford s estate or a tenth part of his merits gladly would i have bestowed either of my own daughters on him maria is nobly married but had mr crawford sought julia s hand i should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than i gave maria s to mr rushworth and i should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this immediately and peremptorily and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation put a decided negative on it i should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding i should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect you are not to be judged by the same rule you do not owe me the duty of a child but fanny if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude,i am very sorry i am very sorry indeed,Fanny Price,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

02022,Henry Crawford,Edmund,714,711,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas,you have a good memory i had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place well and how did you like what you saw,Dr. Grant; Edmund; Fanny Price; Lady Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; William Price,M,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

02025,Henry Crawford,Edmund,895,900,it will be a favourite i believe from this hour but i do not think i have had a volume of shakespeare in my hand before since i was fifteen i once saw henry the eighth acted or i have heard of it from somebody who did i am not certain which but shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how it is a part of an englishman s constitution his thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere one is intimate with him by instinct no man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise,Edmund; Fanny Price; Lady Bertram,M,major,M,major,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

02060,Fanny Price,Sir Thomas,859,864,you are mistaken sir you are quite mistaken how could mr crawford say such a thing i gave him no encouragement yesterday on the contrary i told him i cannot recollect my exact words but i am sure i told him that i would not listen to him that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect and that i begged him never to talk to me in that manner again i am sure i said as much as that and more and i should have said still more if i had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously but i did not like to be i could not bear to be imputing more than might be intended i thought it might all pass for nothing with him,refuse mr crawford upon what plea for what reason,Sir Thomas,F,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

02066,Fanny Price,Sir Thomas,873,874,no sir,it is of no use i perceive to talk to you we had better put an end to this most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting i will therefore only add as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct that you have disappointed every expectation i had formed and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what i had supposed for i had fanny as i think my behaviour must have shewn formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to england i had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days even in young women and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence but you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse that you can and will decide for yourself without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you without even asking their advice you have shewn yourself very very different from anything that i had imagined the advantage or disadvantage of your family of your parents your brothers and sisters never seems to have had a moment s share in your thoughts on this occasion how they might be benefited how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you is nothing to you you think only of yourself and because you do not feel for mr crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness you resolve to refuse him at once without wishing even for a little time to consider of it a little more time for cool consideration and for really examining your own inclinations and are in a wild fit of folly throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled as will probably never occur to you again here is a young man of sense of character of temper of manners and of fortune exceedingly attached to you and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way and let me tell you fanny that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half mr crawford s estate or a tenth part of his merits gladly would i have bestowed either of my own daughters on him maria is nobly married but had mr crawford sought julia s hand i should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than i gave maria s to mr rushworth and i should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this immediately and peremptorily and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation put a decided negative on it i should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding i should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect you are not to be judged by the same rule you do not owe me the duty of a child but fanny if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude,Sir Thomas,F,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

02152,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,16,287,i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether i have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars if you are i will begin directly,i do not believe there is much difference,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1

02154,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,22,35,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam,indeed i shall say no such thing,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
02155,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,24,728,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

02158,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,30,599,and are you altogether pleased with bath,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02159,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,32,289,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02160,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,34,27,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense,yes sir i was at the play on tuesday,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

02162,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,38,606,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
02163,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,40,414,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02164,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,42,508,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars,why what do you mean,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
02165,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,44,277,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar,yes quite more so indeed,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
02166,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,54,659,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
02167,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,59,422,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
02168,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,61,608,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
02169,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,264,577,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours,then you will persuade him to go away,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
02170,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,266,701,that you think they cannot be compared together,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
02171,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,268,683,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02172,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,270,663,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02173,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,272,269,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02174,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,274,279,and is that to be my only security alas alas,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
02175,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,276,583,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before,is not it the same thing,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
02176,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,278,365,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02177,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,280,671,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02178,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,282,37,you are not fond of the country,if you please,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
02179,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,284,589,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
02180,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,286,687,do you not,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
02181,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,288,273,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02182,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,290,585,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
02183,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,364,703,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02184,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,366,665,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02185,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,368,706,me i take offence,but he will tell only half of it,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02186,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,370,675,i angry i could have no right,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
02187,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,413,510,you have been abroad then,i do not understand you,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
02188,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,415,726,why not,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
02189,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,419,595,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
02190,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,421,43,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home,and what are they,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
02191,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,435,271,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,no indeed i never thought of that,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
02192,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,437,713,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,oh not seriously,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
02193,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,507,420,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02194,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,509,19,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so,about a week sir,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

02196,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,513,41,bravo an excellent satire on modern language,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02197,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,515,667,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
02198,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,517,55,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world,how can you be so,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
02199,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,519,579,and did isabella never change her mind before,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02200,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,521,62,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself,well then i will not,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0

02217,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,611,610,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02218,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,613,25,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock,yes sir i was there last monday,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
02219,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,615,438,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
02220,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,617,371,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness,well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

02222,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,625,581,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose,yes very sure,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

02228,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,666,436,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02229,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,670,23,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal,never sir,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
02230,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,672,616,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
02231,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,674,587,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1
02232,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,676,575,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

02240,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,702,367,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

02247,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,727,715,i am persuaded that he never did,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

02256,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,33,523,my journal,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02257,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,35,674,indeed i shall say no such thing,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

02259,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,39,280,but perhaps i keep no journal,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02260,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,41,607,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

02262,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,45,594,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

02265,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,265,688,but they are such very different things,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02266,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,267,426,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02267,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,269,586,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
02268,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,271,660,no indeed i never thought of that,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02269,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,273,417,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02270,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,275,680,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
02271,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,277,272,yes quite more so indeed,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02272,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,279,292,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02273,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,281,368,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there,me i take offence,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
02274,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,283,729,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02275,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,285,672,do i,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02276,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,287,38,i do not believe there is much difference,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
02277,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,289,580,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen,and are you sure it is my brother s doing,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
02278,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,291,447,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02279,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,365,276,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before,Henry Tilney; Mrs. Allen,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
02280,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,367,702,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this,Henry Tilney; Mrs. Allen,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02281,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,369,413,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry,you have been abroad then,Henry Tilney; Mrs. Allen,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
02282,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,412,617,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02283,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,414,682,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
02284,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,416,666,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02285,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,420,716,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
02286,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,422,727,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,i am persuaded that he never did,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
02287,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,425,600,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02288,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,434,44,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
02289,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,436,274,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,and is that to be my only security alas alas,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

02291,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,506,423,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

02298,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,520,582,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

02305,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,585,366,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02306,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,587,511,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
02307,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,589,707,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother,a quarter would be enough,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
02308,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,591,509,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02309,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,593,63,am i i only ask what i want to be told,thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02310,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,595,686,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
02311,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,599,270,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02312,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,602,46,but how can that be are not you with her,i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02313,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,604,278,how sorry you must be for that,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02314,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,606,40,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02315,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,608,590,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about,i can have no opinion on that subject,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
02316,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,610,625,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02317,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,612,605,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure,i am always sorry to leave eleanor,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
02318,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,614,615,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02319,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,616,26,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing,have you been to the theatre,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
02320,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,622,437,but we have a charming morning after it and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02321,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,624,415,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers,why not,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
02322,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,626,288,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
02323,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,655,578,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02324,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,657,34,i have been to see your mother s room,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
02325,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,659,519,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow,and did isabella never change her mind before,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
02326,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,661,596,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
02327,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,663,712,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
02328,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,665,731,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
02329,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,667,435,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02330,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,671,24,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
02331,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,673,611,but your father was he afflicted,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02332,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,675,584,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
02333,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,679,521,no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02334,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,681,613,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02335,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,683,668,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02336,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,685,421,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02337,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,687,664,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
02338,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,697,723,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant,it will soon be as if you never had,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02339,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,699,284,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
02340,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,701,515,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
02341,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,703,370,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,i angry i could have no right,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
02342,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,706,627,but he will tell only half of it,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02343,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,711,517,go away and why,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02344,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,713,684,oh not seriously,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02345,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,715,588,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02346,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,722,676,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
02347,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,724,268,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02348,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,726,725,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
02349,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,728,704,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

02425,Isabella Thorpe,Catherine Morland,556,496,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits,Catherine Morland,F,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

02885,Captain Wentworth,Anne Elliot,421,426,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me,i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion,Anne Elliot,M,major,F,major,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03032,Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,320,299,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him,i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

03043,Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,342,347,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03044,Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,344,339,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03045,Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,346,285,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation,yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

03064,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,321,314,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man,i did,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
03065,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,323,336,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back,yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03066,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,325,224,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03067,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,327,286,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character,the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
03068,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,329,330,but was not she a very low woman,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03069,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,331,304,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now,oh if these are your only objections mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03070,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,333,324,thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03071,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,335,320,can you really,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03073,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,339,344,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03074,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,341,342,indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03077,Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,347,346,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03103,Charles Musgrove,Captain Wentworth,418,421,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me,Anne Elliot; Captain Wentworth,M,intermediate,M,major,Persuasion,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03244,Mr. Darcy,Mr. Bingley,243,257,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03245,Mr. Darcy,Mr. Bingley,245,50,the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else,i would not be so fastidious as you are for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03266,Jane,Elizabeth,480,709,but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03341,Elizabeth,Jane,508,474,yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can,if we thought alike of miss bingley your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03342,Elizabeth,Jane,510,852,yes in conjunction with his friend,mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03343,Elizabeth,Jane,512,1112,your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride,very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03344,Elizabeth,Jane,699,1006,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him,it must have been his sister s doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03345,Elizabeth,Jane,701,511,but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham,i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03346,Elizabeth,Jane,703,61,but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day this will not do you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you chuse,dear lizzy,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
03347,Elizabeth,Jane,705,413,oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather,no i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03348,Elizabeth,Jane,707,988,there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it,but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03349,Elizabeth,Jane,709,712,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty,how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
03350,Elizabeth,Jane,711,1114,indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you,what do you mean,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
03351,Elizabeth,Jane,713,838,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03352,Elizabeth,Jane,715,893,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03354,Elizabeth,Jane,824,834,and have you heard from him often,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03357,Elizabeth,Jane,835,1116,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself,my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
03358,Elizabeth,Jane,837,65,and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married,certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
03359,Elizabeth,Jane,839,370,but not before they went to brighton,laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03362,Elizabeth,Jane,845,836,could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife,yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03363,Elizabeth,Jane,847,478,oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it,how can you talk so you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03364,Elizabeth,Jane,849,1010,oh jane was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day,i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

03366,Elizabeth,Jane,853,976,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied,my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

03370,Elizabeth,Jane,894,881,if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

03374,Elizabeth,Jane,1005,513,i suspected as much but how did he account for it,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03377,Elizabeth,Jane,1107,503,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged,i must think your language too strong in speaking of both and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03378,Elizabeth,Jane,1109,840,you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself,no i believe not,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
03379,Elizabeth,Jane,1111,827,there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother,my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

03382,Elizabeth,Jane,1117,854,it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley,he meant i believe to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03383,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,66,69,you began the evening well charlotte you were mr bingley s first choice,perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03384,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,68,78,oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
03385,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,70,86,upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03386,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,77,67,i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise,yes but he seemed to like his second better,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

03437,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,189,1081,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03438,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,193,1083,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03440,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,220,1103,and so ended his affection there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection,Kitty; Lydia; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Bennet,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

03443,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,255,1145,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03445,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,262,661,oh i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

03449,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,290,596,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own,Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

03451,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,294,1149,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body,i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly,Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
03452,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,379,1089,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03453,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,381,1147,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible,my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03454,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,383,663,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
03455,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,385,397,i must not decide on my own performance when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance,i am,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
03456,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,390,190,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine,yes i do comprehend a great deal in it,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
03457,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,392,399,books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings,i hope not,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
03458,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,394,1095,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
03459,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,396,665,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
03460,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,398,1085,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03461,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,400,391,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first,what think you of books,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
03462,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,402,293,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
03463,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,404,1139,i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly,because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
03464,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,406,380,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
03465,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,595,403,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me,and what is your success,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
03466,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,597,386,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
03467,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,600,1105,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03468,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,602,254,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
03469,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,607,1091,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
03470,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,610,795,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
03471,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,612,295,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again,and yours is wilfully to misunderstand them,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
03472,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,614,1133,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03473,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,616,384,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
03474,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,618,291,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03475,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,620,395,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
03476,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,622,284,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
03477,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,624,793,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
03478,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,658,286,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03479,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,660,99,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
03480,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,662,243,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
03481,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,664,659,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03482,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,666,211,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
03483,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,668,623,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

03491,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1074,619,mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
03492,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1076,797,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03494,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1080,613,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03496,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1084,256,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it,will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03497,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1086,778,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
03498,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1088,1087,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
03499,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1090,1077,had you then persuaded yourself that i should,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03500,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1092,1143,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening,a man who had felt less might,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
03501,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1094,621,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03502,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1096,194,your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03503,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1098,1099,i must ask whether you were surprised,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03504,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1100,1075,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03505,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1102,791,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03506,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1104,1101,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03507,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1132,615,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03508,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1134,401,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,may i ask to what these questions tend,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
03509,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1136,667,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03510,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1138,603,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
03511,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1140,1137,but i was embarrassed,was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
03512,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1142,669,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03513,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1144,1079,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03514,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1146,382,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
03515,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1148,1097,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03516,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,99,1138,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03517,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,192,1082,all this she must possess and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading,i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

03519,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,211,1080,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Miss Bingley; Mrs. Bennet,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

03521,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,247,1104,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
03522,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,252,1142,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
03523,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,254,400,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

03525,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,270,222,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

03529,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,293,666,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03530,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,380,1150,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing,and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03531,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,382,670,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine,this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood how despicably have i acted i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03532,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,384,193,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
03533,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,386,402,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
03534,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,389,612,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
03535,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,391,1084,what think you of books,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
03536,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,393,1146,i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03537,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,395,381,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03538,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,397,406,i am,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
03539,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,399,385,i hope not,i must not decide on my own performance when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
03540,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,401,392,may i ask to what these questions tend,books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
03541,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,403,624,and what is your success,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03542,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,405,253,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
03543,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,596,1092,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03544,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,601,668,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03545,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,603,604,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
03546,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,606,1140,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done,but i was embarrassed,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
03547,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,611,1076,perfectly so i thank you,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03548,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,613,383,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03549,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,615,390,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03550,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,617,294,mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
03551,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,619,398,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
03552,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,621,285,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance,certainly there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03553,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,623,792,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03554,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,657,287,in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you,such as vanity and pride,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
03555,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,659,100,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,you are severe on us,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
03556,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,661,248,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03557,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,663,1102,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
03558,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,665,662,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03559,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,667,292,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,that is a failing indeed implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03560,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,669,1134,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
03561,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,791,618,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03562,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,793,597,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03563,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,795,607,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03564,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,797,396,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03565,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,980,616,yes she will remain there till christmas,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
03566,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1075,658,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03567,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1077,602,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
03568,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1079,620,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1
03569,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1081,664,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
03570,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1083,255,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03571,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1085,798,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me,oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03572,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1087,1088,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03573,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1089,1144,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03574,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1091,1098,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses,i must ask whether you were surprised,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
03575,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1093,1100,hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
03576,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1095,660,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03577,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1097,394,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
03578,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1099,195,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen,i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
03579,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1101,212,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
03580,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1103,1086,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03791,Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,432,439,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03792,Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,434,433,i am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

03795,Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,440,435,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03804,Elizabeth,George Wickham,345,346,but what can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03807,Elizabeth,George Wickham,351,354,how strange how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

03836,George Wickham,Elizabeth,342,943,there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me,i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

03867,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,435,440,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
03868,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,437,421,indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled,indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04081,Mr. Gardiner,Mrs. Gardiner,779,780,he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming,there is something a little stately in him to be sure but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04082,Mr. Gardiner,Mrs. Gardiner,781,782,i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling,to be sure lizzy he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
04083,Mr. Gardiner,Mrs. Gardiner,783,784,but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds,from what we have seen of him i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04085,Mrs. Gardiner,Mr. Gardiner,782,781,to be sure lizzy he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable,i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,M,minor,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04086,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,803,812,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04087,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,807,804,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,do you really think so,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
04088,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,809,808,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
04089,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,811,810,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04090,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,806,807,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
04091,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,808,809,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04092,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,810,811,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04093,Mrs. Bennet,Mr. Gardiner,829,830,if i had been able to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now here s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done,Elizabeth; Jane; Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,PrideAndPrejudice,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04118,John Dashwood,Fanny,0,15,it was my father s last request to me that i should assist his widow and daughters,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04119,John Dashwood,Fanny,2,21,he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04120,John Dashwood,Fanny,4,9,why to be sure that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition,there is no knowing what they may expect but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
04121,John Dashwood,Fanny,6,1,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes,he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
04122,John Dashwood,Fanny,8,11,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04123,John Dashwood,Fanny,10,19,certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04124,John Dashwood,Fanny,12,17,that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04125,John Dashwood,Fanny,14,23,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04126,John Dashwood,Fanny,16,7,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04127,John Dashwood,Fanny,18,3,i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father,well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04136,Fanny,John Dashwood,11,16,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04137,Fanny,John Dashwood,13,22,to be sure it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in,that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04138,Fanny,John Dashwood,15,8,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04139,Fanny,John Dashwood,17,4,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,why to be sure that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04140,Fanny,John Dashwood,19,14,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1
04141,Fanny,John Dashwood,21,696,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it,they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04142,Fanny,John Dashwood,695,6,i do not see how it can be done without affronting lady middleton for they spend every day with her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shows but they are lady middleton s visitors how can i ask them away from her,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes,John Dashwood,F,minor,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04143,Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,24,210,it is enough to say that he is unlike fanny is enough it implies everything amiable i love him already,i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04175,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,218,482,i confess that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other,that is very true but of her society separately from that of other people you will scarcely have any thing at all and you will almost always appear in public with lady middleton,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04176,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,220,872,no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure,i know it is or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04177,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,222,219,you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed,how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04178,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,224,223,i hope not i believe not i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent,a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister s wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04179,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,226,221,why do you not ask marianne at once whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially,but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
04180,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,479,207,though with your usual anxiety for our happiness you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed,yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04181,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,481,28,my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence,i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
04182,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,871,213,colonel brandon s character as an excellent man is well established,concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04183,Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,873,876,his character however does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04212,Marianne,Elinor,53,587,mama you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has nothing to do with matrimony,i will leave you if you will go to bed,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
04213,Marianne,Elinor,55,93,a woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other,he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
04214,Marianne,Elinor,57,551,but he talked of flannel waistcoats and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble,no engagement,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
04215,Marianne,Elinor,86,893,that is exactly what i think of him,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife,Elinor; Mr. Willoughby,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04216,Marianne,Elinor,92,39,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome,i am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly of his sense and his goodness no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne,Elinor; Mr. Willoughby,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04217,Marianne,Elinor,97,712,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy,Elinor; Mr. Willoughby,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04218,Marianne,Elinor,171,889,why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself,you consider the matter exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self denial is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04219,Marianne,Elinor,173,549,mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life,you must not talk so marianne have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04220,Marianne,Elinor,175,878,on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
04221,Marianne,Elinor,177,276,if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith s grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby s and,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
04222,Marianne,Elinor,230,708,it is he it is indeed i know it is,by feeling that i was doing my duty my promise to lucy obliged me to be secret i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother and once or twice i have attempted it but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you,Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04223,Marianne,Elinor,233,710,a fortnight,yes but i did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04225,Marianne,Elinor,238,496,oh with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight,how odd indeed if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04226,Marianne,Elinor,246,56,no not all we could not be more unfortunately situated,it would be impossible i know to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

04232,Marianne,Elinor,283,239,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure,it is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
04233,Marianne,Elinor,297,176,i am afraid it is but too true but why should you boast of it,but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04235,Marianne,Elinor,438,98,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned,you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart,Anne Steele; Elinor; Lady Middleton; Lucy Steele; Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04236,Marianne,Elinor,495,298,has no letter been left here for me since we went out are you quite sure of it are you certain that no servant no porter has left any letter or note how very odd,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own,Elinor; Footman,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04237,Marianne,Elinor,498,561,that is true i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country it is charming weather for them indeed how much they must enjoy it but it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight,whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence,Elinor; Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

04239,Marianne,Elinor,506,37,it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking,no taste for drawing why should you think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of improving it had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right i hope marianne you do not consider him as deficient in general taste indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04240,Marianne,Elinor,508,54,yes a little not much,perhaps thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying her,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04241,Marianne,Elinor,510,569,nay elinor this reproach from you you who have confidence in no one,it would be impossible to go to morrow we owe mrs jennings much more than civility and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1

04277,Elinor,Marianne,39,558,i am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly of his sense and his goodness no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne,he did feel the same elinor for weeks and weeks he felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest supplication had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton the morning that we parted too when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again his distress can i ever forget his distress elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04278,Elinor,Marianne,41,238,i do not attempt to deny that i think very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him,oh with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04280,Elinor,Marianne,50,566,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs,and yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her who is she who can she be whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance oh no one no one he talked to me only of myself elinor i must go home i must go and comfort mama can not we be gone to morrow,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04281,Elinor,Marianne,54,745,perhaps thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying her,but it is in somersetshire i cannot go into somersetshire there where i looked forward to going no elinor you cannot expect me to go there,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
04282,Elinor,Marianne,56,257,it would be impossible i know to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders,elinor for shame money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

04284,Elinor,Marianne,82,881,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask,i would suppose him oh how gladly would i suppose him only fickle very very fickle i am not wishing him too much good when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own he will suffer enough in them,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

04288,Elinor,Marianne,176,879,but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct,yes my peace of mind is doubly involved in it for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of such designs but what must it make me appear to myself what in a situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04290,Elinor,Marianne,231,175,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air,on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure,Margaret; Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

04292,Elinor,Marianne,239,55,it is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves,a woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04295,Elinor,Marianne,258,83,perhaps we may come to the same point your competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say and without them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting your ideas are only more noble than mine come what is your competence,elinor is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

04297,Elinor,Marianne,282,568,i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge,yes why should i stay here i came only for willoughby s sake and now who cares for me who regards me,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
04298,Elinor,Marianne,298,883,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own,no i compare it with what it ought to have been i compare it with yours,Edward Ferrars; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

04327,Elinor,Marianne,708,544,by feeling that i was doing my duty my promise to lucy obliged me to be secret i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother and once or twice i have attempted it but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you,forgive me forgive me i know you feel for me i know what a heart you have but yet you are you must be happy edward loves you what oh what can do away such happiness as that,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
04328,Elinor,Marianne,710,546,yes but i did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her,no no no he loves you and only you you can have no grief,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
04329,Elinor,Marianne,712,299,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy,it is very true that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04336,Elinor,Marianne,891,42,the whole of his behaviour from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle,esteem him like him cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use those words again and i will leave the room this moment,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
04337,Elinor,Marianne,893,570,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife,well then another day or two perhaps but i cannot stay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people the middletons and palmers how am i to bear their pity the pity of such a woman as lady middleton oh what would he say to that,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04338,Elinor,Marianne,927,928,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit,Edward Ferrars; Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04342,Edward Ferrars,Mrs. Dashwood,317,46,i do assure you that i have long thought on this point as you think now it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being we never could agree in our choice of a profession i always preferred the church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended the army that was a great deal too smart for me the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i was too old when the subject was first started to enter it and at length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since,it is but a cottage but i hope to see many of my friends in it a room or two can easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find none in accommodating them,Mrs. Dashwood,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04458,Colonel Brandon,Elinor,612,107,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too,upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being

04484,Elinor,Colonel Brandon,751,612,the smallness of the house i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his

04572,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,770,777,you would not have gone however without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person mrs jennings was quite right in what she said i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper i am charged with a most agreeable office colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well judging a friend and to join in his wish that the living it is about two hundred a year were much more considerable and such as might better enable you to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself such in short as might establish all your views of happiness,colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability i have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him highly he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
04573,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,772,281,yes colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which i am sure marianne myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion,i believe you are right and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
04574,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,774,270,the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where,what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04575,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,776,289,you are very much mistaken i do assure you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandon s discernment of it i have had no hand in it i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift as a friend of mine of my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word you owe nothing to my solicitation,she knows her own worth too well for false shame shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful i should not be shy,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04576,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,778,923,indeed i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion house it is particularly important that he should be all this,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04579,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,922,920,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to miss lucy steele yes they were married last week and are now at dawlish,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04580,Elinor,Edward Ferrars,924,918,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,at longstaple no my mother is in town,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

04633,Edward Ferrars,Elinor,921,286,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,quite the contrary,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
04634,Edward Ferrars,Elinor,923,924,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04635,Edward Ferrars,Elinor,926,927,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,Elinor; Marianne,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

04693,Anne Steele,Elinor,735,740,oh did not you but it was said i know very well and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother s wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live upon that he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it but to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that oh la one can t repeat such kind of things you know she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons,well it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

04716,Elinor,Lucy Steele,448,419,indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them mr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother,no considering our situation it was not strange our first care has been to keep the matter secret you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you and as he was always particularly afraid of his sister s suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it,Lucy Steele,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04718,Elinor,Lucy Steele,453,473,but what are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth,how unlucky that is i had quite depended upon meeting you there anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years but i only go for the sake of seeing edward he will be there in february otherwise london would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it,Lucy Steele,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04721,Elinor,Lucy Steele,464,454,then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little,if we could be certain that it would be only for a while but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and the idea of that for edward s sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures,Lucy Steele,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
04722,Elinor,Lucy Steele,466,465,no on such a subject i certainly will not you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes,i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement we seem so beset with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood,Lucy Steele,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04812,Elinor,Mrs. Jennings,764,702,no ma am not even lucy if you please one day s delay will not be very material and till i have written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else i shall do that directly it is of importance that no time should be lost with him for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

04859,John Dashwood,Elinor,654,793,why i hope not that i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands i must have sold out to very great loss other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your mother far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c to supply the place of what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrars s kindness is,about two hundred a year,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

04863,John Dashwood,Elinor,662,641,her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises,yes he has very good property in dorsetshire,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

04885,Elinor,John Dashwood,665,798,she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks,ah elinor your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance of human nature when edward s unhappy match takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04886,Elinor,John Dashwood,791,658,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward,upon the knoll behind the house the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower garden will slope down just before it and be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow she seems a most valuable woman indeed her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten she must have a great deal to leave,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04887,Elinor,John Dashwood,793,662,about two hundred a year,her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
04888,Elinor,John Dashwood,795,660,a very simple one to be of use to mr ferrars,but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
04889,Elinor,John Dashwood,797,652,but why should such precaution be used though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent,not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
