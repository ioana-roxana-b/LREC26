01121,Professor Godbole,Cyril Fielding,1068,1049,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz,Cyril Fielding,M,intermediate,M,major,APassageToIndia,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
01122,Professor Godbole,Cyril Fielding,1070,1071,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground,yes yes,Cyril Fielding,M,intermediate,M,major,APassageToIndia,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
