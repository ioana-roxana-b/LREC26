p00003_A,00003,A,you see we don t like to take
p00004_A,00004,A,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p00005_A,00005,A,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p00006_A,00006,A,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p00007_A,00007,A,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p00008_A,00008,A,oh how glad i am the name of our house is windy corner there is mother and me generally and my brother though it s not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean
p00009_A,00009,A,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p00010_A,00010,A,don t neglect the country round the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort
p00011_A,00011,A,prato they must go to prato that place is too sweetly squalid for words i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know
p00012_A,00012,A,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p00013_A,00013,A,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p00014_A,00014,A,not at all i never suggested that
p00015_A,00015,A,but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness
p00016_A,00016,A,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p00017_A,00017,A,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p00018_A,00018,A,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p00019_A,00019,A,my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally
p00020_A,00020,A,mr emerson is engaged but here is his son instead
p00021_A,00021,A,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p00022_A,00022,A,poor young man
p00023_A,00023,A,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p00024_A,00024,A,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p00025_A,00025,A,if it is mrs grundy who is troubling you i do assure you that you can neglect the good person being english miss honeychurch will be perfectly safe italians understand a dear friend of mine contessa baroncelli has two daughters and when she cannot send a maid to school with them she lets them go in sailor hats instead every one takes them for english you see especially if their hair is strained tightly behind i will take you by a dear dirty back way miss honeychurch and if you bring me luck we shall have an adventure tut tut miss lucy i hope we shall soon emancipate you from baedeker he does but touch the surface of things as to the true italy he does not even dream of it the true italy is only to be found by patient observation
p00026_A,00026,A,you are a clever woman you have done more than all the relics in the world i am not of your creed but i do believe in those who make their fellow creatures happy there is no scheme of the universe
p00027_A,00027,A,niente
p00028_A,00028,A,no i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the door it is too bad she simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself
p00029_A,00029,A,why shouldn t you
p00030_A,00030,A,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p00031_A,00031,A,but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker
p00032_A,00032,A,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p00033_A,00033,A,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p00034_A,00034,A,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p00035_A,00035,A,i am not touchy i hope it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are
p00036_A,00036,A,some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up it did happen like that if it happened at all
p00037_A,00037,A,pardon me the chapel is somewhat small for two parties we will incommode you no longer
p00038_A,00038,A,stop there s plenty of room for us all stop
p00039_A,00039,A,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p00040_A,00040,A,he will not come back
p00041_A,00041,A,how silly of them i think that a kind action done tactfully
p00042_A,00042,A,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p00043_A,00043,A,in the nave
p00044_A,00044,A,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p00045_A,00045,A,oh dear miss honeychurch you will catch a chill and mr beebe here besides who would suppose this is italy there is my sister actually nursing the hot water can no comforts or proper provisions i could hear your beautiful playing miss honeychurch though i was in my room with the door shut doors shut indeed most necessary no one has the least idea of privacy in this country and one person catches it from another
p00046_A,00046,A,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p00047_A,00047,A,what was that
p00048_A,00048,A,it was a novel and i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink she said but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour this novel is to be about modern italy the other was historical but that she could not start till she had an idea first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came here this must on no account get round and so cheerful through it all i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them all the same she is a little too i hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived i don t know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely
p00049_A,00049,A,stomach he warned miss pole of her stomach acidity he called it and he may have meant to be kind i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought she thought they were commercial travellers was the word she used and all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson then miss lavish said just imagine tut the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak i said it was horrible speaking i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice the woman i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place but that was not all after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers
p00050_A,00050,A,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p00051_A,00051,A,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p00052_A,00052,A,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p00053_A,00053,A,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p00054_A,00054,A,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p00055_A,00055,A,italians dear you know
p00056_A,00056,A,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p00057_A,00057,A,i shall want to live i say
p00058_A,00058,A,no charlotte it s very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you i had much rather
p00059_A,00059,A,oh let me congratulate you after your despair of yesterday what a fortunate thing
p00060_A,00060,A,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p00061_A,00061,A,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p00062_A,00062,A,do not blame her please mr eager the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned
p00063_A,00063,A,so you were here alone miss honeychurch
p00064_A,00064,A,practically
p00065_A,00065,A,one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home
p00066_A,00066,A,were over at the loggia
p00067_A,00067,A,oh so he has a wife
p00068_A,00068,A,exposure
p00069_A,00069,A,do you mean that he is an irreligious man we know that already
p00070_A,00070,A,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p00071_A,00071,A,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p00072_A,00072,A,how could you think she was defending them
p00073_A,00073,A,she will find it difficult for that man has murdered his wife in the sight of god
p00074_A,00074,A,i must be going
p00075_A,00075,A,oh you droll person pray what would become of your drive in the hills
p00076_A,00076,A,so miss honeychurch you are travelling as a student of art
p00077_A,00077,A,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p00078_A,00078,A,oh no i am here as a tourist
p00079_A,00079,A,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day

p00084_A,00084,A,victory at last
p00085_A,00085,A,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature
p00086_A,00086,A,the point is we have warred with it look fifty miles of spring and we ve come up to admire them do you suppose there s any difference between spring in nature and spring in man but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both
p00087_A,00087,A,the railway
p00088_A,00088,A,eleanor
p00089_A,00089,A,i m sure it s all right the emersons won t hear and they wouldn t mind if they did

p00130_A,00130,A,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p00131_A,00131,A,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p00132_A,00132,A,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p00133_A,00133,A,then may i write to my misses alan
p00134_A,00134,A,really
p00135_A,00135,A,mrs honeychurch what if we two walk home and leave you

p00147_A,00147,A,i don t know whether they re any emersons
p00148_A,00148,A,emerson s a common enough name
p00149_A,00149,A,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p00150_A,00150,A,oh yes and you will be satisfied too for they re friends of cecil so you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety
p00151_A,00151,A,don t be rude dear lucy don t screech it s a new bad habit you re getting into
p00152_A,00152,A,friends of cecil s
p00153_A,00153,A,but cecil s emersons they can t possibly be the same ones there is that
p00154_A,00154,A,the emersons who were at florence do you mean no i don t suppose it will prove to be them it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyse s oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people the queerest people for our part we liked them didn t we
p00155_A,00155,A,fiasco s done you this time
p00156_A,00156,A,these particular emersons consisted of a father and a son the son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immature pessimism et cetera our special joy was the father such a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife
p00157_A,00157,A,murdered his wife lucy don t desert us go on playing bumble puppy really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place that s the second murderer i ve heard of as being there whatever was charlotte doing to stop by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time

p00245_A,00245,A,no he isn t well
p00246_A,00246,A,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p00247_A,00247,A,my mother i was meaning
p00248_A,00248,A,no read away i think nothing s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go

p00257_A,00257,A,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p00258_A,00258,A,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p00259_A,00259,A,mr emerson has had to go
p00260_A,00260,A,what a nuisance that spoils the four i say cecil do play do there s a good chap it s floyd s last day do play tennis with us just this once
p00261_A,00261,A,good bye cecil
p00262_A,00262,A,yes
p00263_A,00263,A,i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch isn t it wonderful isn t it romance most certainly they will go to constantinople they are taken in a snare that cannot fail they will end by going round the world isn t romance capricious i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn no ordinary view will content the miss alans they want the pension keats
p00264_A,00264,A,i m awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe but have you any matches
p00265_A,00265,A,then you don t see the wonder of this greek visit i haven t been to greece myself and don t mean to go and i can t imagine any of my friends going it is altogether too big for our little lot don t you think so italy is just about as much as we can manage italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilish i am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus all right freddy i am not being clever upon my word i am not i took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when you ve done with them i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian big enough in all conscience the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me there the contrast is just as much as i can realize but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria
p00266_A,00266,A,you re quite right greece is not for our little lot
p00267_A,00267,A,how do you do
p00268_A,00268,A,oh must you yes do not the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full already i m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it yes charlotte i don t want you do go there s nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it
p00269_A,00269,A,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p00270_A,00270,A,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p00271_A,00271,A,they re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy won t play with me in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday
p00272_A,00272,A,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p00273_A,00273,A,but i must go somewhere i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing i must and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring you all think much too highly of me i wish you weren t so kind
p00274_A,00274,A,i must get away ever so far i must know my own mind and where i want to go
p00275_A,00275,A,come along tea tea tea
p00276_A,00276,A,lucy can always play
p00277_A,00277,A,one is very thankful that she has such a resource she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be i know all about it the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak
p00278_A,00278,A,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p00279_A,00279,A,you may well ask that why greece what is it minnie dear jam why not tunbridge wells oh mr beebe i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning i cannot help her i will say no more perhaps i have already said too much i am not to talk i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused
p00280_A,00280,A,otherwise
p00281_A,00281,A,mrs honeychurch go to greece she must come up to the house and let s talk it over do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse
p00282_A,00282,A,mr beebe i m thankful simply thankful

p00289_A,00289,A,however we shall see him when he sees you off i do so long to see him
p00290_A,00290,A,no one will see lucy off she doesn t like it
p00291_A,00291,A,no i hate seeings off
p00292_A,00292,A,really how funny i should have thought that in this case
p00293_A,00293,A,oh mrs honeychurch you aren t going it is such a pleasure to have met you
p00294_A,00294,A,you re tired of windy corner

p00297_A,00297,A,certainly i forgot it was friday let s all go powell can go round to the stables
p00298_A,00298,A,don t you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans now miss honeychurch go back keep warm i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling
p00299_A,00299,A,i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you
p00300_A,00300,A,one minute mother
p00301_A,00301,A,i don t follow you mr emerson to whom do you refer trust whom
p00302_A,00302,A,i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george they have loved one another all along

p00304_A,00304,A,oh rubbish miss honeychurch
p00305_A,00305,A,it is not rubbish it s the part of people that you don t understand
p00306_A,00306,A,mr beebe could you help me
p00307_A,00307,A,nothing mr emerson except that he no longer interests me marry george miss honeychurch he will do admirably
p00308_A,00308,A,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p00309_A,00309,A,san miniato i ll just finish your sock

p00001_B,00001,B,you see we don t like to take
p00002_B,00002,B,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p00003_B,00003,B,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p00004_B,00004,B,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p00005_B,00005,B,oh oh why it s mr beebe oh how perfectly lovely oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are oh

p00008_B,00008,B,i am eating it thank you and enjoying it
p00009_B,00009,B,don t neglect the country round the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort
p00010_B,00010,B,that lady looks so clever we are in luck
p00011_B,00011,B,emerson
p00012_B,00012,B,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p00013_B,00013,B,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p00014_B,00014,B,was i a bore why didn t you talk lucy he prefers young people i m sure i do hope i haven t monopolized him i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinner time
p00015_B,00015,B,he is nice just what i remember he seems to see good in everyone no one would take him for a clergyman
p00016_B,00016,B,undoubtedly he was
p00017_B,00017,B,my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally
p00018_B,00018,B,remember lucy i alone am implicated in this i do not wish the acceptance to come from you grant me that at all events
p00019_B,00019,B,mr emerson is engaged but here is his son instead
p00020_B,00020,B,poor young man
p00021_B,00021,B,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p00022_B,00022,B,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p00023_B,00023,B,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p00024_B,00024,B,how you do do everything
p00025_B,00025,B,is it a very nice smell
p00026_B,00026,B,i m not sure she understands english
p00027_B,00027,B,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p00028_B,00028,B,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p00029_B,00029,B,but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker
p00030_B,00030,B,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p00031_B,00031,B,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p00032_B,00032,B,thank you very much but i could not think of that i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience
p00033_B,00033,B,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p00034_B,00034,B,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p00035_B,00035,B,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p00036_B,00036,B,stop there s plenty of room for us all stop
p00037_B,00037,B,george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate
p00038_B,00038,B,perhaps he is i don t remember
p00039_B,00039,B,my father has that effect on nearly everyone he will try to be kind
p00040_B,00040,B,i hope we all try
p00041_B,00041,B,were you snubbed
p00042_B,00042,B,oh but your son wants employment has he no particular hobby why i myself have worries but i can generally forget them at the piano and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother perhaps italy bores him you ought to try the alps or the lakes
p00043_B,00043,B,poor girl poor girl
p00044_B,00044,B,if miss honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays it will be very exciting both for us and for her
p00045_B,00045,B,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p00046_B,00046,B,what was that
p00047_B,00047,B,stomach he warned miss pole of her stomach acidity he called it and he may have meant to be kind i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought she thought they were commercial travellers was the word she used and all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson then miss lavish said just imagine tut the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak i said it was horrible speaking i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice the woman i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place but that was not all after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers
p00048_B,00048,B,let me finish the story miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said she went at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience
p00049_B,00049,B,whatever happened
p00050_B,00050,B,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p00051_B,00051,B,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p00052_B,00052,B,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p00053_B,00053,B,italians dear you know
p00054_B,00054,B,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p00055_B,00055,B,she oughtn t really to go at all and she knows it i put it down to too much beethoven
p00056_B,00056,B,and the murderer tried to kiss him you say how very odd italians are and gave himself up to the police mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterday what was that what did you throw in
p00057_B,00057,B,no charlotte it s very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you i had much rather
p00058_B,00058,B,oh let me congratulate you after your despair of yesterday what a fortunate thing
p00059_B,00059,B,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p00060_B,00060,B,what is the heroine s name
p00061_B,00061,B,she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word none but the superficial would be shocked at her we had a long talk yesterday she believes in justice and truth and human interest she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman mr eager why how nice what a pleasant surprise
p00062_B,00062,B,practically
p00063_B,00063,B,one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home
p00064_B,00064,B,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p00065_B,00065,B,he died by the fountain i believe
p00066_B,00066,B,willingly would i purchase
p00067_B,00067,B,what
p00068_B,00068,B,lucy dear
p00069_B,00069,B,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p00070_B,00070,B,you have said very little
p00071_B,00071,B,how could you think she was defending them
p00072_B,00072,B,i must be going
p00073_B,00073,B,drive oh is our drive to come off
p00074_B,00074,B,bother the drive it is just the drive we had arranged with mr beebe without any fuss at all why should he invite us in that absurd manner we might as well invite him we are each paying for ourselves
p00075_B,00075,B,oh dear me no oh no
p00076_B,00076,B,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p00077_B,00077,B,oh indeed are you indeed if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little handed about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl you know the american girl in punch who says and the father replies there s travelling for you ha ha ha
p00078_B,00078,B,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p00079_B,00079,B,piano piano
p00080_B,00080,B,most certainly i would let them be but i dare say i shall receive scant support i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life this is what i call an adventure
p00081_B,00081,B,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p00082_B,00082,B,victory at last
