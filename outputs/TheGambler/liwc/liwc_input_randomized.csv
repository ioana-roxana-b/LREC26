p00000_A,00000,A,i suppose you would like to take them to the casino to play roulette well excuse my speaking so plainly but i know how addicted you are to gambling though i am not your mentor nor wish to be at least i have a right to require that you shall not actually compromise me
p00001_A,00001,A,but you will soon be in receipt of some let us calculate we must translate these roubles into thalers here take 100 thalers as a round sum the rest will be safe in my hands you must not be offended at what i say you are too touchy about these things what i have said i have said merely as a warning to do so is no more than my right
p00002_A,00002,A,to spit into it
p00003_A,00003,A,oh no it is not true and you you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country
p00004_A,00004,A,to what idol
p00005_A,00005,A,my good sir may i ask you what this is that you have gone and done
p00006_A,00006,A,with a german why the german was the baron burmergelm a most important personage i hear that you have been rude both to him and to the baroness
p00007_A,00007,A,but i understand that you simply terrified them my good sir
p00008_A,00008,A,you are only making fun of me
p00009_A,00009,A,enough sir enough i say once and for all i must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence to justify yourself in the eyes of the baron and baroness will be impossible any intercourse with you even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons they would look upon as a degradation i may tell you that on learning that you formed part of my household the baron approached me in the casino and demanded of me additional satisfaction do you understand then what it is that you have entailed upon me upon me my good sir you have entailed upon me the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the baron and to give him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my establishment
p00010_A,00010,A,no i of my own initiative thought that i ought to afford him that satisfaction and with it he was satisfied so we must part good sir it is my duty to hand over to you forty g lden three florins as per the accompanying statement here is the money and here the account which you are at liberty to verify farewell from henceforth we are strangers from you i have never had anything but trouble and unpleasantness i am about to call the landlord and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards i shall no longer be responsible for your hotel expenses also i have the honour to remain your obedient servant
p00011_A,00011,A,what do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense do you not realise the harm that it is doing me i beg of you not to laugh at me sir not to laugh at me for we have police authorities here who out of respect for my rank and for that of the baron in short sir i swear to you that i will have you arrested and marched out of the place to prevent any further brawling on your part do you understand what i say
p00012_A,00012,A,and then you will have ruined my whole family i and my family are her heirs for she has no nearer relatives than ourselves i tell you frankly that my affairs are in great very great disorder how much they are so you yourself are partially aware if she should lose a large sum or maybe her whole fortune what will become of us of my children or of me alexis ivanovitch i beg of you to save us
p00013_A,00013,A,refuse to take her about simply leave her alone
p00014_A,00014,A,stop her stop her
p00015_A,00015,A,oh alexis ivanovitch save me save me have some mercy upon me have mercy mercy
p00016_A,00016,A,in russia or in any well ordered state where there exists a government old women like my mother are placed under proper guardianship yes my good sir do you not know this do you not know this that in russia old women like her are subjected to restraint the devil take them he has gone away and everything which i possess is mortgaged to him i stand stripped to my skin even of the money which you brought me from paris i know not if seven hundred francs be left of course that sum will do to go on with but as regards the future i know nothing i know nothing
p00017_A,00017,A,i have no money for gambling
p00018_A,00018,A,in paris too i had a dispute with a pole and then with a french officer who supported him after that a section of the frenchmen present took my part they did so as soon as i told them the story of how once i threatened to spit into monsignor s coffee
p00019_A,00019,A,i beg pardon yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the two russian ineptitude or the german method of growing rich through honest toil
p00020_A,00020,A,i would rather live a wandering life in tents than bow the knee to a german idol
p00021_A,00021,A,to the german method of heaping up riches i have not been here very long but i can tell you that what i have seen and verified makes my tartar blood boil good lord i wish for no virtues of that kind yesterday i went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere i found that things were even as we read of them in good german picture books that every house has its vater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable so honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and i cannot bear people of that sort each such vater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching do not be angry general let me tell you something that is even more touching than that i can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother yes i know how things ought to be done yet every german family is bound to slavery and to submission to its vater they work like oxen and amass wealth like jews suppose the vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded for the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital yes such things are done for i have been making inquiries on the subject it is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been rightly sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge what more have i to tell well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son perhaps he has his gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden so the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated then the vater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies in turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous vater and the old story begins again in fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original vater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to his son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a baron rothschild or a hoppe and company or the devil knows what is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all what is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves yes there you have it in a nutshell for my own part i would rather grow fat after the russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette i have no wish to be hoppe and company at the end of five generations i want the money for myself for in no way do i look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital i may be wrong but there you have it those are my views
p00022_A,00022,A,i should be glad if we could come straight to the point probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a german
p00023_A,00023,A,no i have not
p00024_A,00024,A,not in the least you must know that when i was in berlin i frequently used to hear the berliners repeat and repellently prolong a certain phrase namely and happening to meet this couple in the carriage drive i found for some reason or another that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits moreover on the three previous occasions that i have met the baroness she has walked towards me as though i were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot not unnaturally i too possess a measure of self respect wherefore on this occasion i took off my hat and said politely yes i assure you it was said politely then the baron turned round and said whereupon i felt moved to ejaculate in answer twice i shouted it at him the first time in an ordinary tone and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which i was capable that is all
p00025_A,00025,A,do not think that it was not so at all i grant you that my behaviour was bad i fully confess that it was so and make no secret of the fact i would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery but more than that it was not also let me tell you that i am very sorry for my conduct yet there is one circumstance which in my eyes almost absolves me from regret in the matter of late that is to say for the last two or three weeks i have been feeling not at all well that is to say i have been in a sick nervous irritable fanciful condition so that i have periodically lost control over myself for instance on more than one occasion i have tried to pick a quarrel even with monsieur le marquise here and under the circumstances he had no choice but to answer me in short i have recently been showing signs of ill health whether the baroness burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when i come to beg her pardon for i do intend to make her amends i do not know but i doubt if she will and the less so since so far as i know the circumstance is one which of late has begun to be abused in the legal world in that advocates in criminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground that at the moment of the crime they the clients were unconscious of what they were doing that in short they were out of health my client committed the murder that is true but he has no recollection of having committed it and doctors actually support these advocates by affirming that there really is such a malady that there really can arise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given deed or only a half or a quarter of it but the baron and baroness are members of an older generation as well as prussian junkers and landowners to them such a process in the medico judicial world will be unknown and therefore they are the more unlikely to accept any such explanation what is your opinion about it general
p00026_A,00026,A,excuse me general but did he make an express point of it that i should cease to belong to your establishment as you call it
p00027_A,00027,A,the matter cannot end here i regret very much that you should have been put to unpleasantness at the baron s hands but the fault pardon me is your own how came you to answer for me to the baron and what did you mean by saying that i formed part of your household i am merely your family tutor not a son of yours nor yet your ward nor a person of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible i am a judicially competent person a man of twenty five years of age a university graduate a gentleman and until i met yourself a complete stranger to you only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me from demanding satisfaction at your hands as well as a further explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon yourself to answer for my conduct nor do i intend to let the baron off and since you general have today been so good as to listen to the baron s complaints and to enter into his concerns since you have made yourself a participator in the affair i have the honour to inform you that tomorrow morning at the latest i shall in my own name demand of the said baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself alone and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person as though i were unworthy to answer for my own conduct
p00028_A,00028,A,general one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled i have not so much as begun my explanations to the baron and you are altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume i wish but to disabuse the baron of what is to me a shameful supposition namely that i am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will it is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself
p00029_A,00029,A,tell me general how am i to do so on what footing do i stand here
p00030_A,00030,A,you had better try and stop her yourself
p00031_A,00031,A,but general possibly mlle blanche has scarcely even remarked my existence what could i do with her
p00032_A,00032,A,then how will you pay your hotel bill and what shall you do afterwards
p00033_A,00033,A,if one is a man of self respect one risks abuse by so doing and is forced to put up with insults of every kind both at paris and on the rhine and even in switzerland there are so many poles with their sympathisers the french at these tables d h te that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a russian
p00034_A,00034,A,but is that how russian subjects ought to be treated why when they settle here they dare not utter even a word they are ready even to deny the fact that they are russians at all events at my hotel in paris i received far more attention from the company after i had told them about the fracas with the sacristan a fat polish nobleman who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d h te at once went upstairs while some of the frenchmen were simply disgusted when i told them that two years ago i had encountered a man at whom in 1812 a french hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket that man was then a boy of ten and his family are still residing in moscow
p00035_A,00035,A,i think that roulette was devised specially for russians
p00036_A,00036,A,upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised westerner there has become historically added though this is not his chief point a capacity for acquiring capital whereas not only is the russian incapable of acquiring capital but also he exhausts it wantonly and of sheer folly none the less we russians often need money wherefore we are glad of and greatly devoted to a method of acquisition like roulette whereby in a couple of hours one may grow rich without doing any work this method i repeat has a great attraction for us but since we play in wanton fashion and without taking any trouble we almost invariably lose
p00037_A,00037,A,see here monsieur de griers i understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary of course i am only un utchitel a tutor and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it consequently i do not know the whole of its circumstances yet pray explain to me this have you yourself become one of its members seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything and are now present as an intermediary
p00038_A,00038,A,in short my one desire is that the baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course
p00039_A,00039,A,in return you must pardon me mon cher marquis and tell me what you have to do with it
p00040_A,00040,A,but what of the general last night he said that for some reason or another it behoved him to move with especial care at present wherefore he was feeling nervous but i did not understand the reference
p00041_A,00041,A,mlle blanche you mean
p00042_A,00042,A,i cannot see that the marriage scheme need be affected by scenes or scandals
p00043_A,00043,A,i do not care seeing that i no longer belong to his household but is it quite settled that mlle is to marry the general what are they waiting for why should they conceal such a matter at all events from ourselves the general s own party
p00044_A,00044,A,ah connected doubtless with madame his mother
p00045_A,00045,A,be so good as to observe that the same family has just expelled me from its bosom all that you are saying you are saying but for show but when people have just said to you of course we do not wish to turn you out yet for the sake of appearance s you must permit yourself to be turned out nothing can matter very much
p00046_A,00046,A,nevertheless i should not go out of doors you are labouring under a delusion monsieur de griers the thing will be done in far better trim than you imagine i was just about to start for mr astley s to ask him to be my intermediary in other words my second he has a strong liking for me and i do not think that he will refuse he will go and see the baron on my behalf and the baron will certainly not decline to receive him although i am only a tutor a kind of subaltern mr astley is known to all men as the nephew of a real english lord the lord piebroch as well as a lord in his own right yes you may be pretty sure that the baron will be civil to mr astley and listen to him or should he decline to do so mr astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself for you know how persistent the english are and thereupon introduce to the baron a friend of his own and he has many friends in a good position that being so picture to yourself the issue of the affair an affair which will not quite end as you think it will
p00047_A,00047,A,very well you can tell mlle not to disturb herself but i would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this note instead of chattering about trifles you ought to have delivered me the missive at once if you have really come commissioned as you say
p00048_A,00048,A,why why
p00049_A,00049,A,but she would soon find some one else to take my place
p00050_A,00050,A,and how am i to do that if only you would undertake the task monsieur de griers
p00051_A,00051,A,of course one always learns something everywhere
p00052_A,00052,A,what really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and a barbarian cela n tait pas si b te
p00053_A,00053,A,impossible no french soldier would fire at a child
p00054_A,00054,A,a man ought to go more carefully though a great many russians go in for gambling they are no good at the game
p00055_A,00055,A,upon what do you base your opinion
p00056_A,00056,A,and what a russian idea
p00057_A,00057,A,i have come to see you on business nor will i seek to conceal from you the fact that i have come in the capacity of an emissary of an intermediary from the general having small knowledge of the russian tongue i lost most of what was said last night but the general has now explained matters and i must confess that
p00058_A,00058,A,i am connected with the general partly through business affairs and partly through special circumstances my principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening what you contemplate is i have no doubt very clever yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your end since not only will the baron refuse to receive you but also he the baron has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from you surely you can see that yourself what then would be the good of going on with it all on the other hand the general promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household and in the meantime will credit you with your salary with vos appointements surely that will suit you will it not good heavens seeing that the general takes such an interest in the matter is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans
p00059_A,00059,A,oh fie what refinements and subtleties besides what have you to express regret for confess monsieur monsieur pardon me but i have forgotten your name confess i say that all this is merely a plan to annoy the general or perhaps you have some other and special end in view eh
p00060_A,00060,A,the general
p00061_A,00061,A,yes there do exist special reasons for his doing so you are acquainted with mlle de cominges are you not
p00062_A,00062,A,yes mlle blanche de cominges doubtless you know also that the general is in love with this young lady and may even be about to marry her before he leaves here imagine therefore what any scene or scandal would entail upon him
p00063_A,00063,A,mais le baron est si irascible un caract re prussien vous savez enfin il fera une querelle d allemand
p00064_A,00064,A,i cannot tell you the marriage is not yet a settled affair for they are awaiting news from russia the general has business transactions to arrange
p00065_A,00065,A,to cut things short i have complete confidence in your native politeness as well as in your tact and good sense i feel sure that you will do what i suggest even if it is only for the sake of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected you
p00066_A,00066,A,very well then seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you it is my duty to mention that other measures will be taken there exist here police you must remember and this very day they shall send you packing que diable to think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging a person like the baron to a duel do you suppose that you will be allowed to do such things just try doing them and see if any one will be afraid of you the reason why i have asked you to desist is that i can see that your conduct is causing the general annoyance do you believe that the baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of doors
p00067_A,00067,A,once more i beg of you to let the matter drop one would think that it actually pleased you to have scenes indeed it is a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you are seeking i have said that the affair may prove to be diverting and even clever and that possibly you may attain something by it yet none the less i tell you that i have come hither also to hand you these few words from a certain person read them please for i must take her back an answer
p00068_A,00068,A,well pardon some natural haste on my part for the situation is so strange i wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions and moreover i did not know the contents of the note and thought that it could be given you at any time
p00069_A,00069,A,eh ce n est pas a mon cher monsieur notre g n ral se trompe what he means to say is that he warns you he begs of you most earnestly not to ruin him i use the expression because
p00070_A,00070,A,ce n est pas a ce n est pas a que diable do not leave her alone so much as advise her persuade her draw her away in any case do not let her gamble find her some counter attraction
p00071_A,00071,A,come what may i must have money and get it somehow i will otherwise i shall be ruined nothing except that two pieces of news have reached us from st petersburg in the first place my grandmother is very ill and unlikely to last another couple of days we had this from timothy petrovitch himself and he is a reliable person every moment we are expecting to receive news of the end
p00072_A,00072,A,of course all of us and every minute of the day for a year and a half now we have been looking for this
p00073_A,00073,A,yes looking for it i am not her blood relation you know i am merely the general s step daughter yet i am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will
p00074_A,00074,A,yes for she is fond of me but how come you to think so
p00075_A,00075,A,and why are you yourself so interested in them
p00076_A,00076,A,it may be so
p00077_A,00077,A,yes that is true as soon as ever he learnt that i was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses i thought you ought to know that
p00078_A,00078,A,you know he has not but where on earth did you pick up this englishman
p00079_A,00079,A,yes he is in love with me
p00080_A,00080,A,oh no there is no doubt about it he does possess some ch teau or other last night the general told me that for certain now are you satisfied
p00081_A,00081,A,and why
p00082_A,00082,A,yes but then the frenchman is a marquis and the cleverer of the two
p00083_A,00083,A,yes absolutely it amuses me to see you grow angry however inasmuch as i allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures you ought to pay me something for the privilege
p00084_A,00084,A,last time you told me when on the shlangenberg that at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss some day i may remind you of that saying in order to see if you will be as good as your word yes you may depend upon it that i shall do so i hate you because i have allowed you to go to such lengths and i also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me for the time being i want you so i must keep you
p00085_A,00085,A,you know who she is just mlle blanche nothing further has transpired probably she will soon be madame general that is to say if the rumours that grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true mlle blanche with her mother and her cousin the marquis know very well that as things now stand we are ruined
p00086_A,00086,A,that has nothing to do with it listen to me take these 700 florins and go and play roulette with them win as much for me as you can for i am badly in need of money
p00087_A,00087,A,why not
p00088_A,00088,A,then are you so certain that your roulette playing will get us out of our difficulties
p00089_A,00089,A,because he is a brute
p00090_A,00090,A,yes and i suppose you want to know why you are aware are you not that the general is mortgaged to the marquis with all his property consequently if the general s mother does not die the frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge
p00091_A,00091,A,yes they are true what then
p00092_A,00092,A,yes something i believe will happen to him
p00093_A,00093,A,yes it is very horrible consequently i am the more surprised that you should be so cheerful what are you so pleased about about the fact that you have gone and lost my money
p00094_A,00094,A,why do you ask me these questions
p00095_A,00095,A,my affairs cannot possibly interest you still if you do wish to know i am in debt i borrowed some money and must pay it back again i have a curious senseless idea that i am bound to win at the gaming tables why i think so i cannot tell but i do think so and with some assurance perhaps it is because of that assurance that i now find myself without any other resource
p00096_A,00096,A,what do not you also hope something from it did you not tell me again and again two weeks ago that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here and did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so were you joking you cannot have been for i remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting
p00097_A,00097,A,and why are you so certain
p00098_A,00098,A,perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so
p00099_A,00099,A,i do not care whether you are so or not well since you ask me i do doubt your ability to take anything seriously you are capable of worrying but not deeply you are too ill regulated and unsettled a person for that but why do you want money not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious
p00100_A,00100,A,what do you mean by asking all these questions you are very clever today surely you are not drunk
p00101_A,00101,A,you talk like a child it is always possible to comport oneself with dignity if one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one
p00102_A,00102,A,and because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money
p00103_A,00103,A,you are losing the thread of the argument if you do not wish to purchase me at all events you wish to purchase my respect
p00104_A,00104,A,no i am not but i order you nevertheless to be silent what rubbish
p00105_A,00105,A,what stupid rubbish
p00106_A,00106,A,why should i have wanted you to leap from the shlangenberg that would have been of no use to me
p00107_A,00107,A,oh no why so i believe you surely you are not a coward
p00108_A,00108,A,whomsoever i wish
p00109_A,00109,A,do not ask me questions return me answers i repeat whomsoever i wish i desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now
p00110_A,00110,A,i am not going to talk to you on that subject i have asked you a question and am waiting for an answer
p00111_A,00111,A,because you have sworn that you would leap from the shlangenberg for my sake and that you would kill any one whom i might bid you kill well instead of such murders and tragedies i wish only for a good laugh go without answering me and let me see the baron give you a sound thrashing with his stick
p00112_A,00112,A,yes i do challenge you go for such is my will
p00113_A,00113,A,ah then i can see that you are only a trifler your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon do i not know that what i have asked you to do is foolish and wrong and that the general will be angry about it but i want to have a good laugh all the same i want that and nothing else why should you insult a woman indeed well you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing
p00114_A,00114,A,hush not so loud
p00115_A,00115,A,take this letter and hand it personally to mr astley go as quickly as ever you can please no answer will be required he himself
p00116_A,00116,A,what is the matter what is the matter
p00117_A,00117,A,if i am here i have come with all that i have to bring such has always been my way as you shall presently see please light a candle read it
p00118_A,00118,A,i expected nothing at all from him long ago i made up my mind on the subject for i could read his thoughts and knew what he was thinking he thought that possibly i should sue him that one day i might become a nuisance so of set purpose i redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him and waited to see what he would do if a telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from st petersburg i should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debts and then dismissed him for a long time i have hated him even in earlier days he was not a man and now oh how gladly i could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face and spit in it and then rub the spittle in
p00119_A,00119,A,no no the general has not got it
p00120_A,00120,A,what makes you speak of her i cannot go and live with her nor will i go down upon my knees to any one
p00121_A,00121,A,in frankfort where he will be staying for the next three days
p00122_A,00122,A,if you were to do that he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs what then would be the use of having a quarrel with him you talk sheer nonsense
p00123_A,00123,A,what you yourself wish me to leave you for him
p00124_A,00124,A,i am not going to take your money
p00125_A,00125,A,because i am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing
p00126_A,00126,A,you are giving too much for me the beloved of de griers is not worth fifty thousand francs
p00127_A,00127,A,you why i hate you yes yes i hate you i love you no more than i do de griers buy me would you would you would you buy me for fifty thousand francs as de griers did you love me do you you who were willing even to quarrel with the baron at my bidding no no you are my dear one you are the man i trust you love me you love me will you always love me yes yes he is there open the window and see if he is not shall we go away tomorrow how would it be if we were to try and overtake grandmamma i think we should do so at berlin and what think you she would have to say to us when we caught her up and her eyes first lit upon us what too about mr astley he would not leap from the shlangenberg for my sake no of that i am very sure do you know where he is going next year he says he intends to go to the north pole for scientific investigations and has invited me to go with him ha ha ha he also says that we russians know nothing can do nothing without european help but he is a good fellow all the same for instance he does not blame the general in the matter but declares that mlle blanche that love but no i do not know i do not know what poor creatures these people are how sorry i am for them and for grandmamma but when are you going to kill de griers surely you do not intend actually to murder him you fool do you suppose that i should allow you to fight de griers nor shall you kill the baron how absurd you looked when you were talking to the burmergelms i was watching you all the time watching you from where i was sitting and how unwilling you were to go when i sent you oh how i laughed and laughed well are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs
p00128_A,00128,A,you have changed your mind then ha ha ha you are sorry you ever promised them the francs are mine then are they they are mine
p00129_A,00129,A,then take your fifty thousand francs
p00130_A,00130,A,all of you are on the tiptoe of expectation
p00131_A,00131,A,looking for it
p00132_A,00132,A,yes i believe that you will come in for a good deal
p00133_A,00133,A,that marquis of yours is he also familiar with your family secrets
p00134_A,00134,A,never mind if i am not mistaken the general has succeeded in borrowing money of the marquis
p00135_A,00135,A,is it likely that the marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother did you notice too that three times during luncheon when speaking of her he called her la baboulenka what loving friendly behaviour to be sure
p00136_A,00136,A,then he has only just begun his courting why i thought he had been doing so a long while
p00137_A,00137,A,i knew you would ask about him he is very shy and susceptible also he is in love with you
p00138_A,00138,A,and he is ten times richer than the frenchman in fact what does the frenchman possess to me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all
p00139_A,00139,A,nevertheless in your place i should marry the englishman
p00140_A,00140,A,because though the frenchman is the handsomer of the two he is also the baser whereas the englishman is not only a man of honour but ten times the wealthier of the pair
p00141_A,00141,A,is that so
p00142_A,00142,A,i consider that i have a perfect right to put these questions to you for the reason that i am ready to pay for them and also care little what becomes of me
p00143_A,00143,A,may i ask you who is this mlle blanche
p00144_A,00144,A,and is the general at last in love
p00145_A,00145,A,because i wish to play for myself that is my sole reason
p00146_A,00146,A,yes possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in peace i am not unwilling so to do but in all probability i should lose
p00147_A,00147,A,have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the general
p00148_A,00148,A,then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged i have heard rumours to that effect but was unaware how far they might be true
p00149_A,00149,A,why it will be a case of farewell mlle blanche for in such an event she would never become madame general do you know i believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over at his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love
p00150_A,00150,A,and what a fine thing it all is could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone not one of the decencies has been observed the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony and as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead what do you think of it polina alexandrovna
p00151_A,00151,A,what the money that you gave me to lose i told you i should never win for other people least of all for you i obeyed you simply because you ordered me to but you must not blame me for the result i warned you that no good would ever come of it you seem much depressed at having lost your money why do you need it so greatly
p00152_A,00152,A,because you promised to explain matters to me listen i am certain that as soon as ever i begin to play for myself and i still have 120 g lden left i shall win you can then take of me what you require you must not be angry with me for making such a proposal i am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me a gift from me could not possibly offend you moreover it was i who lost your g lden
p00153_A,00153,A,or perhaps it is because it is so necessary for you to win it is like a drowning man catching at a straw you yourself will agree that unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree
p00154_A,00154,A,true i always felt certain that i should win indeed what you say makes me ask myself why have my absurd senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind yet i am still positive that so soon as ever i begin to play for myself i shall infallibly win
p00155_A,00155,A,to tell the truth i do not know i only know that i must win that it is the one resource i have left yes why do i feel so assured on the point
p00156_A,00156,A,yet i dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter
p00157_A,00157,A,by the way you say you want to pay off a debt it must be a large one is it to the frenchman
p00158_A,00158,A,you know that you and i stand on no ceremony and that sometimes i put to you very plain questions i repeat that i am your slave and slaves cannot be shamed or offended
p00159_A,00159,A,a maxim straight from the copybook suppose i cannot comport myself with dignity by that i mean that though i am a man of self respect i am unable to carry off a situation properly do you know the reason it is because we russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression it is all a question of mode most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour and genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists it belongs only to the french though a few other europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons that is why with us the mode is so all important the frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown but a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum that is why our good ladies are so fond of frenchmen the frenchman s manners they say are perfect but in my opinion there is no such thing as a frenchman s manners the frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois at the same time as i am not a woman i do not properly understand the question cocks may be excellent birds if i am wrong you must stop me you ought to stop and correct me more often when i am speaking to you for i am too apt to say everything that is in my head you see i have lost my manners i agree that i have none nor yet any dignity i will tell you why i set no store upon such things everything in me has undergone a cheek you know the reason i have not a single human thought in my head for a long while i have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in russia i have been to dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what dresden is like you know the cause of my obsession i have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore i tell you outright that wherever i go i see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference why or how i have come to love you i do not know it may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon do you know i am ignorant even as to what your face is like in all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble
p00160_A,00160,A,when have i thought to do so
p00161_A,00161,A,not at all i have told you that i find it difficult to explain myself you are hard upon me do not be angry at my chattering you know why you ought not to be angry with me that i am simply an imbecile however i do not mind if you are angry sitting in my room i need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once i fall almost to biting my hands why should you be angry with me because i call myself your slave revel i pray you in my slavery revel in it do you know that sometimes i could kill you not because i do not love you or am jealous of you but because i feel as though i could simply devour you you are laughing
p00162_A,00162,A,i do not care also do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together often i have a feeling that i should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you are you certain that it will never come to that you are driving me to frenzy am i afraid of a scandal or of your anger why should i fear your anger i love without hope and know that hereafter i shall love you a thousand times more if ever i should kill you i should have to kill myself too but i shall put off doing so as long as possible for i wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me do you know a very strange thing it is that with every day my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility why should i not become a fatalist remember how on the third day that we ascended the shlangenberg i was moved to whisper in your ear had you said it i should have leapt do you not believe me
p00163_A,00163,A,i care not whether it be wise or stupid i only know that in your presence i must speak speak speak therefore i am speaking i lose all conceit when i am with you and everything ceases to matter
p00164_A,00164,A,splendid i know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me i can see through you of no use did you say why to give pleasure is always of use and as for barbarous unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why it is a kind of luxury man is a despot by nature and loves to torture you in particular love to do so
p00165_A,00165,A,i do not know perhaps i am but i do not know i have long given up thinking about such things
p00166_A,00166,A,the frenchman
p00167_A,00167,A,do you rather tell me what is going on here why do you seem half afraid of me i can see for myself what is wrong you are the step daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a blanche and there is this frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you yet you actually ask me such a question if you do not tell me how things stand i shall have to put in my oar and do something are you ashamed to be frank with me are you shy of me
p00168_A,00168,A,well then i will kill whomsoever you wish but are you really going to bid me do such deeds
p00169_A,00169,A,then you throw me out a challenge you think that i will not do it
p00170_A,00170,A,then i will go however mad be your fancy only look here shall you not be doing the general a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself it is not about myself i am worrying it is about you and the general why for a mere fancy should i go and insult a woman
p00171_A,00171,A,i have perpetrated the the piece of idiocy
p00172_A,00172,A,polina alexandrovna
p00173_A,00173,A,something startled me just now and i looked round and saw you some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form
p00174_A,00174,A,why the fact that you are here
p00175_A,00175,A,it is de griers handwriting all this is clear enough surely you did not expect aught else from him
p00176_A,00176,A,but the document returning the fifty thousand rouble mortgage has the general got it if so possess yourself of it and send it to de griers
p00177_A,00177,A,just as i expected well what is the general going to do what about the grandmother
p00178_A,00178,A,why should you yet to think that you should have loved de griers the villain the villain but i will kill him in a duel where is he now
p00179_A,00179,A,well bid me do so and i will go to him by the first train tomorrow
p00180_A,00180,A,the question is how to raise the fifty thousand francs we cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor listen what of mr astley
p00181_A,00181,A,i have won two hundred thousand francs shall i put the money there until tomorrow polina here are twenty five thousand florins fifty thousand francs or more take them and tomorrow throw them in de griers face or if you should prefer let me take them to him myself tomorrow yes early tomorrow morning shall i
p00182_A,00182,A,why not why not polina
p00183_A,00183,A,but i am offering it to you as a friend in the same way i would offer you my very life
p00184_A,00184,A,oh polina how can you speak so am i de griers
p00185_A,00185,A,polina you say that again again
p00186_A,00186,A,yes they have always been yours
p00187_A,00187,A,that mlle blanche well i have seen a good many women like her it is so does mlle polina like flowers
p00188_A,00188,A,what you cannot say
p00189_A,00189,A,hm then i have an idea in my mind
p00190_A,00190,A,i was just coming to see you and you appear to be out on a similar errand so you have parted with your employers
p00191_A,00191,A,by no means not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment indeed i have never heard any one speak of it
p00192_A,00192,A,because i have had occasion to do so whither are you bound i like you and was therefore coming to pay you a visit
p00193_A,00193,A,that i never doubted
p00194_A,00194,A,and concerning this marquis and mlle polina you know nothing beyond surmise
p00195_A,00195,A,then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine things about them
p00196_A,00196,A,i feel the same about it as for mlle polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances for my own part i think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially and as for mlle polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as mlle polina are to say the least of it unbecoming but she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter
p00197_A,00197,A,your eyes look very fiery and in them i can read suspicion now you have no right whatever to be suspicious it is not a right which i can for a moment recognise and i absolutely refuse to answer your questions
p00198_A,00198,A,yes i think i do know more about it than you do the affair centres around this mlle blanche of that i feel certain
p00199_A,00199,A,well my belief is that at the present moment mlle blanche has in very truth a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the baron and the baroness it might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a scandal
p00200_A,00200,A,also i may tell you that mlle blanche has been in roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago i myself was in the place at the time and in those days mlle blanche was not known as mlle de cominges nor was her mother the widow de cominges even in existence in any case no one ever mentioned the latter de griers too had not materialised and i am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance likewise the marquisate de griers is of recent creation of that i have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance even the name de griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that i have a friend who once met the said marquis under a different name altogether
p00201_A,00201,A,possibly mlle blanche also may possess that yet it is not three years since she received from the local police at the instance of the baroness an invitation to leave the town and she left it
p00202_A,00202,A,well i must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name barberini or something of the kind the fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage at first mlle blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse i distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum but worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous upon this mlle zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as madame barberini was in despair she shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy in the hotel there was staying also a polish count you must know that all travelling poles are counts and the spectacle of mlle zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression so the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled indeed that evening the couple entered the casino arm in arm mlle zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown for instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside doubtless you have noticed them
p00203_A,00203,A,well they are not worth noticing to the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart however mlle zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal suddenly the count too disappeared even as the prince had done and that same evening mlle zelma was forced to appear in the casino alone on this occasion no one offered her a greeting two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the baron burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval to his distaste however mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red later that evening a complaint from the baroness led the authorities to request mlle not to re enter the casino if you feel in any way surprised that i should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that i had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove mlle zelma in his carriage from roulettenberg to spa now mark you mlle wants to become madame general in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from casino authorities as she received three years ago at present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players yes that is a much more paying game i even suspect that the unfortunate general is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also de griers or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the baron and the baroness drawn to herself in short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental you form a member of the m nage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the general or with mlle polina now do you understand
p00204_A,00204,A,it would have done no good to warn you for the reason that you could have effected nothing against what was i to warn you as likely as not the general knows more about mlle blanche even than i do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and mlle polina only yesterday i saw this frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with de griers while the general was careering in their wake on a roan horse he had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough as he passed i looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever however it is no affair of mine for i have only recently had the happiness to make mlle polina s acquaintance also i have already told you that i do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you
p00205_A,00205,A,you forget in the first place that this mlle de cominges is the general s inamorata and in the second place that mlle polina the general s step daughter has a younger brother and sister who though they are the general s own children are completely neglected by this madman and robbed as well
p00206_A,00206,A,in whom
p00207_A,00207,A,ah then of course their interests centre around her it is a question of succession let that but be settled and the general will marry mlle polina will be set free and de griers
p00208_A,00208,A,will be repaid his money which is what he is now waiting for
p00209_A,00209,A,i know of nothing else
p00210_A,00210,A,yes i did hear a woman s voice calling but whose i do not know the someone was calling you in russian ah now i can see whence the cries come they come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys behind her see that pile of luggage she must have arrived by train
p00211_A,00211,A,indeed she arrived at the casino even before i had taken my departure by train so i knew she had been playing if i should have time i will go to the casino to night and take a look at her the thing interests me
p00212_A,00212,A,to frankfort
p00213_A,00213,A,she is ill
p00214_A,00214,A,yes she is in my rooms
p00215_A,00215,A,yes i am minded to keep her there
p00216_A,00216,A,yes i have it was i who told you about it had she not been ill she would not have gone and spent the night with you
p00217_A,00217,A,yes for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative of mine unfortunately being ill she made a mistake and went to your rooms instead
p00218_A,00218,A,indeed no i was not there but i was waiting in the corridor and walking about the hotel
p00219_A,00219,A,yes she ought i have sent for one and if she dies i shall hold you responsible
p00220_A,00220,A,never mind tell me if it is true that last night you won two hundred thousand thalers
p00221_A,00221,A,because all russians who have grown rich go to paris
p00222_A,00222,A,indeed i am sure that you do not moreover if you were to stay here you would lose everything that you possess and have nothing left with which to pay your expenses in paris well good bye now i feel sure that today will see you gone from here
p00223_A,00223,A,i daresay yet i hardly suppose that that will break the general s heart moreover mlle polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses in short we may say that as a family this family has ceased to exist
p00224_A,00224,A,you here well i had an idea that i should meet you do not trouble to tell me anything for i know all yes all in fact your whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge
p00225_A,00225,A,oh dear no though i knew all the time that you were lying there
p00226_A,00226,A,no i am afraid i could not
p00227_A,00227,A,well i am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your buoyancy
p00228_A,00228,A,your remarks please me as they always did in those words i see the clever triumphant and above all things cynical friend of former days only russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded all thinking persons know that ancient truth yet on the present occasion i assure you i am sincerely glad to see that you are not cast down tell me are you never going to give up gambling
p00229_A,00229,A,that you are losing i thought so you need not tell me any more i know how things stand for you have said that last in despair and therefore truthfully have you no other employment than gambling
p00230_A,00230,A,you are growing blas you have not only renounced life with its interests and social ties but the duties of a citizen and a man you have not only renounced the friends whom i know you to have had and every aim in life but that of winning money but you have also renounced your memory though i can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life i feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle numbers and so forth
p00231_A,00231,A,then you will have to be here another ten years should i then be alive i will remind you here on this very bench of what i have just said in fact i will bet you a wager that i shall do so
p00232_A,00232,A,no i do not think it was she at the present moment she is in switzerland and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her
p00233_A,00233,A,mlle polina is the best of all possible living beings but i repeat that i shall thank you to cease questioning me about her you never really knew her and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling
p00234_A,00234,A,well on condition that the matter shall end there i will tell you that for a long time mlle polina was ill and still is so my mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of england and thereafter mlle polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman died and left mlle polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling that was about six months ago and now mlle is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married mlle s little brother and sister also benefited by the grandmother s will and are now being educated in london as for the general he died in paris last month of a stroke mlle blanche did well by him for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the grandmother that i think concludes all that i have to tell
p00235_A,00235,A,no nor do i know where he is also i warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me
p00236_A,00236,A,yes in spite of our old friendship
p00237_A,00237,A,if you do not care to hear their names coupled together may i ask you what you mean by the expressions and there being anything between them why do you call them so particularly a frenchman and a russian lady
p00238_A,00238,A,yes i belong to the well known firm of lovell and co
p00239_A,00239,A,you are saying this because you are feeling bitter yet there is not the least originality in your words
p00240_A,00240,A,yes you are for you are only talking nonsense are you aware that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you are it was at her request i came to homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes and your recollections of her too
p00241_A,00241,A,yes poor unfortunate she did love you and i may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost even if i were also to tell you that she still loves you you would none the less have to remain where you are yes you have ruined yourself beyond redemption once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent and you were of a lively disposition and your good looks were not to be despised you might even have been useful to your country which needs men like you yet you remained here and your life is now over i am not blaming you for this in my view all russians resemble you or are inclined to do so if it is not roulette then it is something else the exceptions are very rare nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours for roulette is not exclusively a russian game hitherto you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you i tremble to think now good bye you are in want of money i suppose then take these ten louis d or more i shall not give you for you would only gamble it away take care of these coins and farewell once more take care of them
p00242_A,00242,A,take care of them i am certain you are still a gentleman and therefore i give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another also if i could be certain that you would leave both homburg and the gaming tables and return to your own country i would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh but i give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other take the money therefore and good bye
p00243_A,00243,A,with pleasure
p00244_A,00244,A,i really cannot say
p00245_A,00245,A,no i have never noticed whether she does so or not
p00246_A,00246,A,how do you know that is every one aware of the fact
p00247_A,00247,A,then how come you to know it
p00248_A,00248,A,what a splendid fellow you are mr astley and since i have not yet had my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely tasted yours let us adjourn to the casino caf where we can sit and smoke and have a talk i do not intend to go away i intend on the contrary to remain here
p00249_A,00249,A,no i fear not
p00250_A,00250,A,no i know nothing for certain about them no nothing
p00251_A,00251,A,quite so quite so i admit that yet that is not the question what do you make of it when i met you i was just coming to ask you your opinion for myself i could have killed this frenchman and am not sure that i shall not do so even yet
p00252_A,00252,A,do you know what i believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from mlle polina herself
p00253_A,00253,A,enough you need say no more very well very well then i stand confounded and have no further opinions to offer but you are a good fellow and i am glad to know what you think about it all even though i do not need your advice for instance what reason should you assign for the general taking fright in this way why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident even de griers has found it necessary to put in his oar and he only interferes on the most important occasions and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplications yes he de griers has actually been playing the suppliant to me and mark you although he came to me as early as nine o clock he had ready prepared in his hand mlle polina s note when i would ask was that note written mlle polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it at all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the frenchman since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon yet what is her personal concern in the matter why is she interested in it at all why too is the whole party so afraid of this precious baron and what sort of a business do you call it for the general to be going to marry mlle blanche de cominges he told me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at present what is your opinion of it all your look convinces me that you know more about it than i do
p00254_A,00254,A,and what of mlle blanche
p00255_A,00255,A,oh oh
p00256_A,00256,A,yet he possesses a good circle of friends
p00257_A,00257,A,but why
p00258_A,00258,A,yes certainly
p00259_A,00259,A,no i do not tell me mr astley why if you knew this history all along and consequently always knew who this mlle blanche is you never warned either myself or the general nor most of all mlle polina how could you do it
p00260_A,00260,A,enough to me it is as clear as day that mlle polina knows all about this mlle blanche but cannot bring herself to part with her frenchman wherefore she consents also to be seen in public with mlle blanche you may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the baron yes it is there that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow yet she herself it was who launched me at the baron the devil take it but i was left no choice in the matter
p00261_A,00261,A,yes yes that is so for me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment whereas if i remain i should be able to defend their interests and perhaps to save a moiety of their property yes yes that is quite true and yet and yet oh i can well understand why they are all so interested in the general s mother
p00262_A,00262,A,in the old woman of moscow who declines to die yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death
p00263_A,00263,A,yes and de griers
p00264_A,00264,A,what you think that he is waiting for that
p00265_A,00265,A,but i do i do he is waiting also for the old woman s will for the reason that it awards mlle polina a dowry as soon as ever the money is received she will throw herself upon the frenchman s neck all women are like that even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned what polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love that is my opinion look at her especially when she is sitting alone and plunged in thought all this was pre ordained and foretold and is accursed polina could perpetrate any mad act she she but who called me by name who is shouting for me i heard some one calling in russian it was a woman s voice listen
p00266_A,00266,A,but why should she be calling me hear her calling again see she is beckoning to us
p00267_A,00267,A,she is gambling away everything that she has
p00268_A,00268,A,where have you been today
p00269_A,00269,A,on business
p00270_A,00270,A,and she is in your rooms
p00271_A,00271,A,then you are minded to keep her there
p00272_A,00272,A,but mr astley that will raise a scandal it ought not to be allowed besides she is very ill perhaps you had not remarked that
p00273_A,00273,A,then you know all about it
p00274_A,00274,A,indeed then i wish you joy mr astley apropos you have reminded me of something were you beneath my window last night every moment mlle polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there after which she always smiled
p00275_A,00275,A,she ought to see a doctor you know mr astley
p00276_A,00276,A,pardon me but what do you mean
p00277_A,00277,A,no i won a hundred thousand florins
p00278_A,00278,A,but what could i do in paris in summer time i love her mr astley surely you know that
p00279_A,00279,A,good bye but i am not going to paris likewise pardon me what is to become of this family i mean that the affair of the general and mlle polina will soon be all over the town
p00280_A,00280,A,how closely you watch the doings of your old friends that does you infinite credit but stop a moment you have reminded me of something was it you who bailed me out of roulettenberg prison when i was lying there for a debt of two hundred g lden someone did so
p00281_A,00281,A,perhaps you could tell me who did bail me out
p00282_A,00282,A,what a strange thing for i know no russians at all here so it cannot have been a russian who befriended me in russia we orthodox folk do go bail for one another but in this case i thought it must have been done by some english stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country
p00283_A,00283,A,which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than i am
p00284_A,00284,A,damn the gambling yes i should certainly have given it up were it not that
p00285_A,00285,A,no none whatever
p00286_A,00286,A,enough mr astley kindly do not recall to me any more recollections for i can remember things for myself only for a time have i put them out of my head only until i shall have rehabilitated myself am i keeping my memory dulled when that hour shall come you will see me arise from the dead
p00287_A,00287,A,say no more and to show you that i have not wholly forgotten the past may i enquire where mlle polina is if it was not you who bailed me out of prison it must have been she yet never have i heard a word concerning her
p00288_A,00288,A,which means that she has dealt you a serious wound
p00289_A,00289,A,indeed on what subject then have i a better right to speak to you than on this with it are bound up all your recollections and mine however do not be alarmed i have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affairs my interest in mlle polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings about them you could tell me in two words
p00290_A,00290,A,and de griers is he too travelling in switzerland
p00291_A,00291,A,what in spite of our old friendship
p00292_A,00292,A,then i beg your pardon a thousand times mr astley i meant nothing offensive to mlle polina for i have nothing of which to accuse her moreover the question of there being anything between this frenchman and this russian lady is not one which you and i need discuss nor even attempt to understand
p00293_A,00293,A,ah i see you are interested mr astley but it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface at the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance a frenchman mr astley is merely a fine figure of a man with this you as a britisher may not agree with it i also as a russian may not agree out of envy yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion for instance one may look upon racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and i too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule yet about him mr astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it yes the frenchman the parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we russians had even ceased to be bears the revolution bequeathed to the french nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance yes taken by himself the frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young russian lady de griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure mr astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him and even though it may offend you i feel bound to say that the majority also of english people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same but to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies at all events they need more experience for instance this mlle polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and i cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to monsieur de griers she may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer de griers this will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that de griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old general and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind only give her the de griers of former days and she will ask of you no more the more she may detest the present de griers the more will she lament the de griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination you are a sugar refiner mr astley are you not
p00294_A,00294,A,then see here on the one hand you are a sugar refiner while on the other hand you are an apollo belvedere but the two characters do not mix with one another i again am not even a sugar refiner i am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey of this fact mlle polina is probably well aware since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal
p00295_A,00295,A,i agree but therein lies the horror of it all that how trepidation playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be they are none the less true but i am only wasting words
p00296_A,00296,A,indeed is that really so
p00297_A,00297,A,no mr astley after all that has been said i
p00298_A,00298,A,yes i will take it if at the same time you will embrace me
p00299_A,00299,A,to a certain extent that is true
p00300_A,00300,A,because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this to this how shall i express it to this old lady cette pauvre terrible vieille but she will only gamble away all that she has gamble it away like thistledown you yourself have seen her play once she has acquired the taste for gambling she will never leave the roulette table but of sheer perversity and temper will stake her all and lose it in cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn away from the game and then and then
p00301_A,00301,A,well at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services but if later
p00302_A,00302,A,what an extraordinary idea
p00303_A,00303,A,for god s sake alexis ivanovitch do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours do you know what is likely to come of it merely further unpleasantness you will agree with me i am sure that at present i ought to move with especial care yes with very especial care you cannot be fully aware of how i am situated when we leave this place i shall be ready to receive you back into my household but for the time being i well i cannot tell you all my reasons o alexis ivanovitch alexis ivanovitch move with especial care at present
p00304_A,00304,A,as much as you like but i myself yes and polina and monsieur de griers too we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you
p00305_A,00305,A,alexis ivanovitch may i say to you that i find it strange exceedingly strange that in short your conduct towards myself and my family in a word your er extremely
p00306_A,00306,A,and there are trees there and we could have tea under them
p00307_A,00307,A,how far you may be right in what you have said i do not know but i do know that you are becoming an insufferable far eur whenever you are given the least chance
p00308_A,00308,A,madame la baronne j ai l honneur d tre votre esclave
p00309_A,00309,A,ja wohl

p00314_A,00314,A,why should you be astonished i just got into my chair and came things are quiet enough in the train for there is no one there to chatter have you been out for a walk
p00315_A,00315,A,oh well it is quite nice here the place seems comfortable and all the trees are out i like it very well are your people at home is the general for instance indoors
p00316_A,00316,A,do they observe the convenances and keep up appearances such things always give one tone i have heard that they are keeping a carriage even as russian gentlefolks ought to do when abroad our russian people always cut a dash is prascovia here too
p00317_A,00317,A,and the frenchwoman however i will go and look for them myself tell me the nearest way to their rooms do you like being here
p00318_A,00318,A,and you potapitch you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve me a suitable suite of rooms they must be handsomely decorated and not too high up have my luggage taken up to them but what are you tumbling over yourselves for why are you all tearing about what scullions these fellows are who is that with you
p00319_A,00319,A,and who is mr astley
p00320_A,00320,A,just so charmante i happen to know you as a mountebank and therefore trust you no more than this and who is that who is that woman there
p00321_A,00321,A,could a chair be carried up that mountain of yours
p00322_A,00322,A,of whom is this a portrait but how know you that you live here yet you cannot say for certain and why is the picture there at all and why do its eyes look so crooked the blockhead what donkeys these people are what a huge counterpane turn it back please further yet further yet turn it right back also take off those pillows and bolsters and lift up the feather bed mercifully it contains no bugs pull off the whole thing and then put on my own pillows and sheets the place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself it is too large for any one person alexis ivanovitch come and see me whenever you are not teaching your pupils
p00323_A,00323,A,why so
p00324_A,00324,A,but i suppose you must have threatened that precious baron or something of the kind however even if you did so it was a matter of no moment
p00325_A,00325,A,what did you do next
p00326_A,00326,A,go and tell him go and tell him to stop and to take his money with him and go home presently he will be losing yes losing everything that he has now won where is potapitch send potapitch to speak to him no you must tell him you must tell him for i have not the least notion where potapitch is sortez sortez how provoking then the young man is done for i suppose he wishes to be ruined yet i could not bear to see him have to return it all what a fool the fellow is that woman is not losing to whom does she belong do you know her who is she
p00327_A,00327,A,ah a bird of passage evidently besides i can see that she has her shoes polished now explain to me the meaning of each round in the game and the way in which one ought to stake but what is zero just now i heard the flaxen haired croupier call out zero and why does he keep raking in all the money that is on the table to think that he should grab the whole pile for himself what does zero mean
p00328_A,00328,A,then i should receive nothing if i were staking
p00329_A,00329,A,why thirty five times when zero so often turns up and if so why do not more of these fools stake upon it
p00330_A,00330,A,rubbish potapitch potapitch come here and i will give you some money go at once and stake that upon zero
p00331_A,00331,A,rubbish stake please
p00332_A,00332,A,to listen to him when will that accursed zero ever turn up i cannot breathe until i see it i believe that that infernal croupier is purposely keeping it from turning up alexis ivanovitch stake two golden pieces this time the moment we cease to stake that cursed zero will come turning up and we shall get nothing
p00333_A,00333,A,there you see you see i told you so it was the lord god himself who suggested to me to stake those two coins now how much ought i to receive why do they not pay it out to me potapitch martha where are they what has become of our party potapitch potapitch
p00334_A,00334,A,we shall be too late he is going to spin again stake stake do not hang back be quick
p00335_A,00335,A,upon zero upon zero again upon zero stake as much as ever you can how much have we got seventy ten g lden pieces we shall not miss them so stake twenty pieces at a time
p00336_A,00336,A,you are wrong utterly wrong stake i tell you what a chattering tongue you have i know perfectly well what i am doing
p00337_A,00337,A,again again again stake again
p00338_A,00338,A,how surprised theodosia too will be she like yourselves shall have the price of a new gown here alexis ivanovitch give that beggar something
p00339_A,00339,A,never mind never mind give him a g lden have you never tried your luck alexis ivanovitch
p00340_A,00340,A,yet just now i could see that you were burning to do so
p00341_A,00341,A,then stake everything upon zero you have seen how it ought to be done how much capital do you possess
p00342_A,00342,A,the man is a perfect fool move on now for i am simply famished when we have lunched we will return to that place
p00343_A,00343,A,what has that got to do with you it is not your money that i am going to lose it is my own and where is that mr astley of yours
p00344_A,00344,A,alexis ivanovitch after luncheon that is to say about four o clock get ready to go out with me again but in the meanwhile good bye do not forget to call a doctor for i must take the waters now go and get rested a little
p00345_A,00345,A,you are all the escort i need stake again how many times have we lost
p00346_A,00346,A,never mind keep on staking upon zero and also stake a thousand g lden upon rouge here is a banknote with which to do so but you see you see we have now recovered almost all that we staked try zero again let us do so another ten times and then leave off to the devil with that zero stake four thousand g lden upon the red
p00347_A,00347,A,to think that that accursed zero should have turned up now the accursed accursed thing and it is all your fault it was you who persuaded me to cease staking upon it
p00348_A,00348,A,you and your mischances go away at once
p00349_A,00349,A,no stay where are you going to why should you leave me you fool no no stay here it is i who was the fool tell me what i ought to do

p00353_A,00353,A,i see they are i see they are ah well i do not mean to rest until i have staked another four thousand
p00354_A,00354,A,and in the purse

p00359_A,00359,A,the thieves never mind though get the documents cashed no send the banker out to me
p00360_A,00360,A,yes one of the clerks the thieves pray recollect yourself and may my money choke you alexis ivanovitch tell him that we can easily repair to someone else
p00361_A,00361,A,well well i am no accountant let us hurry away hurry away

p00365_A,00365,A,and good bye to you also alexis ivanovitch the train starts in an hour s time and i think that you must be weary of me take these five hundred g lden for yourself
p00366_A,00366,A,alexis ivanovitch walk on ahead and we will set out again
p00367_A,00367,A,i cannot rest until i have retrieved my losses march on ahead and ask me no questions play continues until midnight does it not
p00368_A,00368,A,and why not what do you mean is every one here a stupid good for nothing
p00369_A,00369,A,pardon me antonida vassilievna i have no reason to wish you ill i am merely rather astonished to see you why should i not be so seeing how unexpected
p00370_A,00370,A,yes i have just been to the casino
p00371_A,00371,A,yes and probably all of them
p00372_A,00372,A,yes polina alexandrovna is here
p00373_A,00373,A,yes i thank you antonida vassilievna
p00374_A,00374,A,a mr astley
p00375_A,00375,A,a fellow traveller and my very good friend as well as an acquaintance of the general s
p00376_A,00376,A,mlle de cominges and this is her mother madame de cominges they also are staying in the hotel
p00377_A,00377,A,doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose
p00378_A,00378,A,after tomorrow i shall no longer be in the general s service but merely living in the hotel on my own account
p00379_A,00379,A,yes and this action on my part the baron held to be an insult and complained about it to the general who yesterday dismissed me from his employ
p00380_A,00380,A,no i did not the baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me
p00381_A,00381,A,i wanted to challenge the baron to a duel but the general protested against my doing so
p00382_A,00382,A,she is i believe a frenchwoman
p00383_A,00383,A,zero is what the bank takes for itself if the wheel stops at that figure everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of the bank also whenever the wheel has begun to turn the bank ceases to pay out anything
p00384_A,00384,A,no unless by any chance you had purposely staked on zero in which case you would receive thirty five times the value of your stake
p00385_A,00385,A,because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty six
p00386_A,00386,A,but madame zero has only this moment turned up wherefore it may not do so again for ever so long wait a little and you may then have a better chance
p00387_A,00387,A,pardon me but zero might not turn up again until say tonight even though you had staked thousands upon it it often happens so
p00388_A,00388,A,my good madame
p00389_A,00389,A,upon what shall i stake madame
p00390_A,00390,A,think a moment madame sometimes zero does not turn up for two hundred rounds in succession i assure you that you may lose all your capital
p00391_A,00391,A,but the rules do not allow of more than 120 g lden being staked upon zero at a time
p00392_A,00392,A,but perhaps he is not a beggar only a rascal
p00393_A,00393,A,no madame

p00399_A,00399,A,but madame i only explained the game to you how am i to answer for every mischance which may occur in it
p00400_A,00400,A,farewell then madame
p00401_A,00401,A,i cannot take it upon myself to advise you for you will only blame me if i do so play at your own discretion say exactly what you wish staked and i will stake it
p00402_A,00402,A,but such a quantity of money
p00403_A,00403,A,i cannot madame the largest stake allowed is four thousand g lden
p00404_A,00404,A,madame your twelve thousand g lden are now gone
p00405_A,00405,A,but you have no money with which to do it madame in this satchel i can see only a few five percent bonds and some transfers no actual cash
p00406_A,00406,A,a mere trifle
p00407_A,00407,A,quite so to any amount you please but you will lose on the transaction what would frighten even a jew
p00408_A,00408,A,a couple of steps madame

p00417_A,00417,A,pardon me but i have nothing to reproach myself with i merely will not go i merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play i also beg to return you your five hundred g lden farewell
p00418_A,00418,A,oh an englishman then that is why he stared at me without even opening his lips however i like englishmen now take me upstairs direct to their rooms where are they lodging
p00419_A,00419,A,oh a russian why i had no idea that he could understand me surely he did not hear what i said as for mr astley i have seen him already and i see that he is here again how do you do have you nothing to say to me say something for goodness sake translate to him polina
p00420_A,00420,A,well here i am and instead of a telegram too what you were not expecting me

p00422_A,00422,A,fibs fibs
p00423_A,00423,A,the most sensible question that i have yet been asked well you shall hear for yourself how it all happened i lay and lay and was doctored and doctored until at last i drove the physicians from me and called in an apothecary from nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady similar to my own cured her merely with a little hayseed well he did me a great deal of good for on the third day i broke into a sweat and was able to leave my bed then my german doctors held another consultation put on their spectacles and told me that if i would go abroad and take a course of the waters the indisposition would finally pass away why should it not i thought to myself so i had got things ready and on the following day a friday set out for here i occupied a special compartment in the train and where ever i had to change i found at the station bearers who were ready to carry me for a few coppers you have nice quarters here but where on earth did you get the money for them my good sir i thought that everything of yours had been mortgaged this frenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal oh i know all about it all about it
p00424_A,00424,A,they do not exceed it fie why you are robbing your children of their last kopeck you their guardian
p00425_A,00425,A,you do not know what by heavens are you never going to drop that roulette of yours are you going to whistle all your property away

p00429_A,00429,A,and why did you so protest for i can see no difference between you and the baron nor can i bear that german visage of yours
p00430_A,00430,A,why not all men are crowing cocks and that is why they quarrel you though i perceive are a blockhead a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding lift me up potapitch see to it that you always have two bearers ready go and arrange for their hire but we shall not require more than two for i shall need only to be carried upstairs on the level or in the street i can be wheeled along go and tell them that and pay them in advance so that they may show me some respect you too potapitch are always to come with me and you alexis ivanovitch are to point out to me this baron as we go along in order that i may get a squint at the precious von and where is that roulette played then take me straight there and do you walk on in front of me alexis ivanovitch
p00431_A,00431,A,martha you must come with me as well
p00432_A,00432,A,rubbish because she is my servant is that a reason for turning her out why she is only a human being like the rest of us and as she has been travelling for a week she might like to look about her with whom else could she go out but myself she would never dare to show her nose in the street alone
p00433_A,00433,A,begone with you and your views

p00473_A,00473,A,prascovia is what i have just heard through a side wind true namely that this fool of a stepfather of yours is going to marry that silly whirligig of a frenchwoman that actress or something worse tell me is it true
p00474_A,00474,A,you need not say any more i understand the situation i always thought we should get something like this from him for i always looked upon him as a futile frivolous fellow who gave himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a general though he only became one because he retired as a colonel yes i know all about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon ah they were looking for the legacies without money that wretched woman what is her name oh de cominges would never dream of accepting the general and his false teeth no not even for him to be her lacquey since she herself they say possesses a pile of money and lends it on interest and makes a good thing out of it however it is not you prascovia that i am blaming it was not you who sent those telegrams nor for that matter do i wish to recall old scores true i know that you are a vixen by nature that you are a wasp which will sting one if one touches it yet my heart is sore for you for i loved your mother katerina now will you leave everything here and come away with me otherwise i do not know what is to become of you and it is not right that you should continue living with these people nay i have not yet finished i ask of you nothing in return my house in moscow is as you know large enough for a palace and you could occupy a whole floor of it if you liked and keep away from me for weeks together will you come with me or will you not
p00475_A,00475,A,what you suppose me to be jesting i have said that i am going and i am going today i have squandered fifteen thousand roubles at that accursed roulette of yours and though five years ago i promised the people of a certain suburb of moscow to build them a stone church in place of a wooden one i have been fooling away my money here however i am going back now to build my church
p00476_A,00476,A,you and your waters do not anger me prascovia surely you are trying to say then will you or will you not come with me
p00477_A,00477,A,you mean that you are not coming
p00478_A,00478,A,now now do not frown but i do not intend to slur things over you will take care that no harm befalls you will you not for you are a girl of sense and i am sorry for you i regard you in a different light to the rest of them and now please leave me good bye
p00479_A,00479,A,and how are you grandmother were you long on the journey
p00480_A,00480,A,there is a ruined castle and the shlangenberg

p00486_A,00486,A,i do not know for certain grandmamma but from mlle blanche s account for she does not appear to think it necessary to conceal anything i conclude that
p00487_A,00487,A,first of all let me ask of you whether you are intending to depart at once
p00488_A,00488,A,but what about the waters grandmamma surely you came here to take the waters
p00489_A,00489,A,grandmamma i am very very grateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me also to a certain extent you have guessed my position aright and i am beholden to you to such an extent that it may be that i will come and live with you and that very soon yet there are important reasons why why i cannot make up my mind just yet if you would let me have say a couple of weeks to decide in
p00490_A,00490,A,i mean only that i cannot come just yet at all events i could not well leave my little brother and sister here since since if i were to leave them they would be abandoned altogether but if grandmamma you would take the little ones and myself then of course i could come with you and would do all i could to serve you only without the little ones i cannot come
p00491_A,00491,A,but let me stay with you a little longer
p00492_A,00492,A,no i don t want to see them i hate kissing children for their noses are always wet how are you getting on theodosia

p00507_A,00507,A,i was watching you all the time madame and i asked potapitch what mistress was trying to do and my word the heaps and heaps of money that were lying upon the table never in my life have i seen so much money and there were gentlefolk around it and other gentlefolk sitting down so i asked potapitch where all these gentry had come from for thought i maybe the holy mother of god will help our mistress among them yes i prayed for you madame and my heart died within me so that i kept trembling and trembling the lord be with her i thought to myself and in answer to my prayer he has now sent you what he has done even yet i tremble i tremble to think of it all
p00508_A,00508,A,but whither madame

p00519_A,00519,A,go away now go away now
p00520_A,00520,A,you are a bold young fellow but mind you depart early tomorrow as early as you can for if you do not you will lose everything that you have won

p00525_A,00525,A,another hundred thousand francs please to remember besides i could live with you in your rooms for a month or even for two or even for longer but it would not take us more than two months to get through fifty thousand francs for look you je suis bonne enfante et tu verras des toiles you may be sure
p00526_A,00526,A,certainly does that surprise you very much ah vil esclave why one month of that life would be better than all your previous existence one month et apr s le d luge mais tu ne peux comprendre va away away you are not worth it ah que fais tu eh bien mon utchitel je t attends si tu veux i start in a quarter of an hour s time
p00527_A,00527,A,what is the matter with you how dull you are come come we are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for you et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi i myself will tie your tie for you and introduce you to hortense and when we have spent your money you shall return here and break the bank again what did those two jews tell you that the thing most needed is daring and that you possess it consequently this is not the first time that you will be hurrying to paris with money in your pocket quant moi je veux cinquante mille francs de rente et alors
p00528_A,00528,A,the general you know well enough that at about this hour every day he goes to buy me a bouquet on this occasion i took care to tell him that he must hunt for the choicest of flowers and when he returns home the poor fellow will find the bird flown possibly he may take wing in pursuit ha ha ha and if so i shall not be sorry for he could be useful to me in paris and mr astley will pay his debts here et les cent mille francs qui nous restent tu les mangeras avec moi mon utchitel so that once and for all i may be on a decent footing and proof against any stones which may be thrown at me at all events for a long time to come what do you want with money see what care and taste can do with the most wretched of means c est un utchitel qui a gagn deux cent mille francs and but for me would have had not a notion how to spend them presently he will have to return to his tutoring does any one know of a vacant post you know one must do something for him bibi surely you are not angry
p00529_A,00529,A,you see i decided to spend so much upon these horses only because i can easily sell them again they would go at any time for twenty thousand francs
p00530_A,00530,A,then you are not angry
p00531_A,00531,A,well well what a man you are mais tu as l esprit pour comprendre sais tu mon gar on although you are a tutor you ought to have been born a prince are you not sorry that your money should be going so quickly
p00532_A,00532,A,mais sais tu mais dis donc are you really rich mais sais tu you have too much contempt for money qu est ce que tu feras apr s dis donc
p00533_A,00533,A,oui oui c est a c est magnifique ah i know you will win them and bring them to me when you have done so dis donc you will end by making me love you since you are what you are i mean to love you all the time and never to be unfaithful to you you see i have not loved you before parce que je croyais que tu n es qu un utchitel quelque chose comme un lacquais n est ce pas yet all the time i have been true to you parce que je suis bonne fille
p00534_A,00534,A,oh oh mais tu es
p00535_A,00535,A,il a de la chance for the grandmother is now really ill and therefore bound to die mr astley has just sent a telegram to say so and you will agree with me that the general is likely to be her heir even if he should not be so he will not come amiss since in the first place he has his pension and in the second place he will be content to live in a back room whereas i shall be madame general and get into a good circle of society and become a russian ch telaine yes i shall have a mansion of my own and peasants and a million of money at my back
p00536_A,00536,A,oh dear no how ridiculous that would be of him besides i have taken measures to prevent it you need not be alarmed that is to say i have induced him to sign notes of hand in albert s name consequently at any time i could get him punished isn t he ridiculous
p00537_A,00537,A,a hundred thousand florins
p00538_A,00538,A,tout autre
p00539_A,00539,A,this moment
p00540_A,00540,A,stop a moment if i were to give you those fifty thousand francs what should i have left for myself
p00541_A,00541,A,what you mean to say that we should spend the whole in two months
p00542_A,00542,A,but what about the general
p00543_A,00543,A,no o o i am merely tired
p00544_A,00544,A,yes yes they are splendid horses and you have got a splendid turn out i am quite content let me hear no more of the matter
p00545_A,00545,A,no why should i be you are wise to provide yourself with what you need for it will all come in handy in the future yes i quite see the necessity of your establishing yourself on a good basis for without it you will never earn your million my hundred thousand francs i look upon merely as a beginning as a mere drop in the bucket
p00546_A,00546,A,no the quicker it goes the better
p00547_A,00547,A,apr s i shall go to homburg and win another hundred thousand francs
p00548_A,00548,A,you lie did i not see you the other day with albert with that black jowled officer
p00549_A,00549,A,yes you are lying right enough but what makes you suppose that i should be angry rubbish il faut que jeunesse se passe even if that officer were here now i should refrain from putting him out of the room if i thought you really cared for him only mind you do not give him any of my money you hear
p00550_A,00550,A,but suppose he should prove jealous he might demand all sorts of things you know do you follow me
p00551_A,00551,A,very well then marry him
p00000_B,00000,B,to the german method of heaping up riches i have not been here very long but i can tell you that what i have seen and verified makes my tartar blood boil good lord i wish for no virtues of that kind yesterday i went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere i found that things were even as we read of them in good german picture books that every house has its vater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable so honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and i cannot bear people of that sort each such vater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching do not be angry general let me tell you something that is even more touching than that i can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother yes i know how things ought to be done yet every german family is bound to slavery and to submission to its vater they work like oxen and amass wealth like jews suppose the vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded for the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital yes such things are done for i have been making inquiries on the subject it is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been rightly sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge what more have i to tell well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son perhaps he has his gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden so the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated then the vater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies in turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous vater and the old story begins again in fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original vater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to his son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a baron rothschild or a hoppe and company or the devil knows what is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all what is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves yes there you have it in a nutshell for my own part i would rather grow fat after the russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette i have no wish to be hoppe and company at the end of five generations i want the money for myself for in no way do i look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital i may be wrong but there you have it those are my views
p00001_B,00001,B,excuse me general but did he make an express point of it that i should cease to belong to your establishment as you call it
p00002_B,00002,B,then how will you pay your hotel bill and what shall you do afterwards
p00003_B,00003,B,do not think that it was not so at all i grant you that my behaviour was bad i fully confess that it was so and make no secret of the fact i would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery but more than that it was not also let me tell you that i am very sorry for my conduct yet there is one circumstance which in my eyes almost absolves me from regret in the matter of late that is to say for the last two or three weeks i have been feeling not at all well that is to say i have been in a sick nervous irritable fanciful condition so that i have periodically lost control over myself for instance on more than one occasion i have tried to pick a quarrel even with monsieur le marquise here and under the circumstances he had no choice but to answer me in short i have recently been showing signs of ill health whether the baroness burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when i come to beg her pardon for i do intend to make her amends i do not know but i doubt if she will and the less so since so far as i know the circumstance is one which of late has begun to be abused in the legal world in that advocates in criminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground that at the moment of the crime they the clients were unconscious of what they were doing that in short they were out of health my client committed the murder that is true but he has no recollection of having committed it and doctors actually support these advocates by affirming that there really is such a malady that there really can arise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given deed or only a half or a quarter of it but the baron and baroness are members of an older generation as well as prussian junkers and landowners to them such a process in the medico judicial world will be unknown and therefore they are the more unlikely to accept any such explanation what is your opinion about it general
p00004_B,00004,B,i should be glad if we could come straight to the point probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a german
p00005_B,00005,B,not in the least you must know that when i was in berlin i frequently used to hear the berliners repeat and repellently prolong a certain phrase namely and happening to meet this couple in the carriage drive i found for some reason or another that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits moreover on the three previous occasions that i have met the baroness she has walked towards me as though i were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot not unnaturally i too possess a measure of self respect wherefore on this occasion i took off my hat and said politely yes i assure you it was said politely then the baron turned round and said whereupon i felt moved to ejaculate in answer twice i shouted it at him the first time in an ordinary tone and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which i was capable that is all
p00006_B,00006,B,i have no money for gambling
p00007_B,00007,B,the matter cannot end here i regret very much that you should have been put to unpleasantness at the baron s hands but the fault pardon me is your own how came you to answer for me to the baron and what did you mean by saying that i formed part of your household i am merely your family tutor not a son of yours nor yet your ward nor a person of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible i am a judicially competent person a man of twenty five years of age a university graduate a gentleman and until i met yourself a complete stranger to you only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me from demanding satisfaction at your hands as well as a further explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon yourself to answer for my conduct nor do i intend to let the baron off and since you general have today been so good as to listen to the baron s complaints and to enter into his concerns since you have made yourself a participator in the affair i have the honour to inform you that tomorrow morning at the latest i shall in my own name demand of the said baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself alone and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person as though i were unworthy to answer for my own conduct
p00008_B,00008,B,general one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled i have not so much as begun my explanations to the baron and you are altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume i wish but to disabuse the baron of what is to me a shameful supposition namely that i am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will it is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself
p00009_B,00009,B,i beg pardon yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the two russian ineptitude or the german method of growing rich through honest toil
p00010_B,00010,B,why do i continue to dance attendance upon the general instead of having left him and his family long ago
p00011_B,00011,B,no i have not
p00012_B,00012,B,but general possibly mlle blanche has scarcely even remarked my existence what could i do with her
p00013_B,00013,B,tell me general how am i to do so on what footing do i stand here
p00014_B,00014,B,just so you must know that on one occasion when for two days i had felt certain that at any moment i might have to depart for rome on business i repaired to the embassy of the holy see in paris to have my passport visaed there i encountered a sacristan of about fifty and a man dry and cold of mien after listening politely but with great reserve to my account of myself this sacristan asked me to wait a little i was in a great hurry to depart but of course i sat down pulled out a copy of l opinion nationale and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against russia which it happened to contain as i was thus engaged i heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for monsignor after which i saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor and then another bow as the visitor took his leave i ventured to remind the good man of my own business also whereupon with an expression of if anything increased dryness he again asked me to wait soon a third visitor arrived who like myself had come on business he was an austrian of some sort and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs this made me very angry i rose approached the sacristan and told him that since monsignor was receiving callers his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment it simply passed his understanding that any insignificant russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of monsignor s in a tone of the utmost effrontery as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me he looked me up and down and then said but i only cried the louder screeched the sacristan again shrinking back in horror then rushing to the door he spread out his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter
p00015_B,00015,B,you had better try and stop her yourself
p00016_B,00016,B,but she would soon find some one else to take my place
p00017_B,00017,B,you are only making fun of me
p00018_B,00018,B,what do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense do you not realise the harm that it is doing me i beg of you not to laugh at me sir not to laugh at me for we have police authorities here who out of respect for my rank and for that of the baron in short sir i swear to you that i will have you arrested and marched out of the place to prevent any further brawling on your part do you understand what i say
p00019_B,00019,B,how far you may be right in what you have said i do not know but i do know that you are becoming an insufferable far eur whenever you are given the least chance
p00020_B,00020,B,but you will soon be in receipt of some let us calculate we must translate these roubles into thalers here take 100 thalers as a round sum the rest will be safe in my hands you must not be offended at what i say you are too touchy about these things what i have said i have said merely as a warning to do so is no more than my right
p00021_B,00021,B,with a german why the german was the baron burmergelm a most important personage i hear that you have been rude both to him and to the baroness
p00022_B,00022,B,no i of my own initiative thought that i ought to afford him that satisfaction and with it he was satisfied so we must part good sir it is my duty to hand over to you forty g lden three florins as per the accompanying statement here is the money and here the account which you are at liberty to verify farewell from henceforth we are strangers from you i have never had anything but trouble and unpleasantness i am about to call the landlord and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards i shall no longer be responsible for your hotel expenses also i have the honour to remain your obedient servant
p00023_B,00023,B,enough sir enough i say once and for all i must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence to justify yourself in the eyes of the baron and baroness will be impossible any intercourse with you even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons they would look upon as a degradation i may tell you that on learning that you formed part of my household the baron approached me in the casino and demanded of me additional satisfaction do you understand then what it is that you have entailed upon me upon me my good sir you have entailed upon me the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the baron and to give him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my establishment
p00024_B,00024,B,for god s sake alexis ivanovitch do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours do you know what is likely to come of it merely further unpleasantness you will agree with me i am sure that at present i ought to move with especial care yes with very especial care you cannot be fully aware of how i am situated when we leave this place i shall be ready to receive you back into my household but for the time being i well i cannot tell you all my reasons o alexis ivanovitch alexis ivanovitch move with especial care at present
p00025_B,00025,B,to what idol
p00026_B,00026,B,to spit into it
p00027_B,00027,B,but i understand that you simply terrified them my good sir
p00028_B,00028,B,yes yes what on earth am i to do what on earth am i to do is this not ingratitude is it not sheer ingratitude
p00029_B,00029,B,refuse to take her about simply leave her alone
p00030_B,00030,B,what an extraordinary idea
p00031_B,00031,B,my good mother my good mother pray let let let us hire a carriage and go for a drive near here there is an enchanting view to be obtained we we we were just coming to invite you to go and see it
p00032_B,00032,B,in russia or in any well ordered state where there exists a government old women like my mother are placed under proper guardianship yes my good sir do you not know this do you not know this that in russia old women like her are subjected to restraint the devil take them he has gone away and everything which i possess is mortgaged to him i stand stripped to my skin even of the money which you brought me from paris i know not if seven hundred francs be left of course that sum will do to go on with but as regards the future i know nothing i know nothing
p00033_B,00033,B,i am connected with the general partly through business affairs and partly through special circumstances my principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening what you contemplate is i have no doubt very clever yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your end since not only will the baron refuse to receive you but also he the baron has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from you surely you can see that yourself what then would be the good of going on with it all on the other hand the general promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household and in the meantime will credit you with your salary with vos appointements surely that will suit you will it not good heavens seeing that the general takes such an interest in the matter is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans
p00034_B,00034,B,to cut things short i have complete confidence in your native politeness as well as in your tact and good sense i feel sure that you will do what i suggest even if it is only for the sake of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected you
p00035_B,00035,B,well pardon some natural haste on my part for the situation is so strange i wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions and moreover i did not know the contents of the note and thought that it could be given you at any time
p00036_B,00036,B,yes mlle blanche de cominges doubtless you know also that the general is in love with this young lady and may even be about to marry her before he leaves here imagine therefore what any scene or scandal would entail upon him
p00037_B,00037,B,oh fie what refinements and subtleties besides what have you to express regret for confess monsieur monsieur pardon me but i have forgotten your name confess i say that all this is merely a plan to annoy the general or perhaps you have some other and special end in view eh
p00038_B,00038,B,yes there do exist special reasons for his doing so you are acquainted with mlle de cominges are you not
p00039_B,00039,B,of course one always learns something everywhere
p00040_B,00040,B,because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this to this how shall i express it to this old lady cette pauvre terrible vieille but she will only gamble away all that she has gamble it away like thistledown you yourself have seen her play once she has acquired the taste for gambling she will never leave the roulette table but of sheer perversity and temper will stake her all and lose it in cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn away from the game and then and then
p00041_B,00041,B,well at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services but if later
p00042_B,00042,B,mais le baron est si irascible un caract re prussien vous savez enfin il fera une querelle d allemand
p00043_B,00043,B,i cannot tell you the marriage is not yet a settled affair for they are awaiting news from russia the general has business transactions to arrange
p00044_B,00044,B,to a certain extent that is true
p00045_B,00045,B,impossible no french soldier would fire at a child
p00046_B,00046,B,the general
p00047_B,00047,B,ce n est pas a ce n est pas a que diable do not leave her alone so much as advise her persuade her draw her away in any case do not let her gamble find her some counter attraction
p00048_B,00048,B,very well then seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you it is my duty to mention that other measures will be taken there exist here police you must remember and this very day they shall send you packing que diable to think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging a person like the baron to a duel do you suppose that you will be allowed to do such things just try doing them and see if any one will be afraid of you the reason why i have asked you to desist is that i can see that your conduct is causing the general annoyance do you believe that the baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of doors
p00049_B,00049,B,upon what do you base your opinion
p00050_B,00050,B,once more i beg of you to let the matter drop one would think that it actually pleased you to have scenes indeed it is a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you are seeking i have said that the affair may prove to be diverting and even clever and that possibly you may attain something by it yet none the less i tell you that i have come hither also to hand you these few words from a certain person read them please for i must take her back an answer
p00051_B,00051,B,be so good as to observe that the same family has just expelled me from its bosom all that you are saying you are saying but for show but when people have just said to you of course we do not wish to turn you out yet for the sake of appearance s you must permit yourself to be turned out nothing can matter very much
p00052_B,00052,B,i would rather live a wandering life in tents than bow the knee to a german idol
p00053_B,00053,B,upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised westerner there has become historically added though this is not his chief point a capacity for acquiring capital whereas not only is the russian incapable of acquiring capital but also he exhausts it wantonly and of sheer folly none the less we russians often need money wherefore we are glad of and greatly devoted to a method of acquisition like roulette whereby in a couple of hours one may grow rich without doing any work this method i repeat has a great attraction for us but since we play in wanton fashion and without taking any trouble we almost invariably lose
p00054_B,00054,B,i understand so you were ordered to hand me the note only in the last resort and if you could not otherwise appease me is it not so speak out monsieur de griers
p00055_B,00055,B,in return you must pardon me mon cher marquis and tell me what you have to do with it
p00056_B,00056,B,in short my one desire is that the baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course
p00057_B,00057,B,and how am i to do that if only you would undertake the task monsieur de griers
p00058_B,00058,B,i do not care seeing that i no longer belong to his household but is it quite settled that mlle is to marry the general what are they waiting for why should they conceal such a matter at all events from ourselves the general s own party
p00059_B,00059,B,in paris too i had a dispute with a pole and then with a french officer who supported him after that a section of the frenchmen present took my part they did so as soon as i told them the story of how once i threatened to spit into monsignor s coffee
p00060_B,00060,B,nevertheless i should not go out of doors you are labouring under a delusion monsieur de griers the thing will be done in far better trim than you imagine i was just about to start for mr astley s to ask him to be my intermediary in other words my second he has a strong liking for me and i do not think that he will refuse he will go and see the baron on my behalf and the baron will certainly not decline to receive him although i am only a tutor a kind of subaltern mr astley is known to all men as the nephew of a real english lord the lord piebroch as well as a lord in his own right yes you may be pretty sure that the baron will be civil to mr astley and listen to him or should he decline to do so mr astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself for you know how persistent the english are and thereupon introduce to the baron a friend of his own and he has many friends in a good position that being so picture to yourself the issue of the affair an affair which will not quite end as you think it will
p00061_B,00061,B,very well you can tell mlle not to disturb herself but i would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this note instead of chattering about trifles you ought to have delivered me the missive at once if you have really come commissioned as you say
p00062_B,00062,B,but what of the general last night he said that for some reason or another it behoved him to move with especial care at present wherefore he was feeling nervous but i did not understand the reference
p00063_B,00063,B,i cannot see that the marriage scheme need be affected by scenes or scandals
p00064_B,00064,B,mlle blanche you mean
p00065_B,00065,B,i think that roulette was devised specially for russians
p00066_B,00066,B,but is that how russian subjects ought to be treated why when they settle here they dare not utter even a word they are ready even to deny the fact that they are russians at all events at my hotel in paris i received far more attention from the company after i had told them about the fracas with the sacristan a fat polish nobleman who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d h te at once went upstairs while some of the frenchmen were simply disgusted when i told them that two years ago i had encountered a man at whom in 1812 a french hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket that man was then a boy of ten and his family are still residing in moscow
p00067_B,00067,B,see here monsieur de griers i understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary of course i am only un utchitel a tutor and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it consequently i do not know the whole of its circumstances yet pray explain to me this have you yourself become one of its members seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything and are now present as an intermediary
p00068_B,00068,B,why why
p00069_B,00069,B,nevertheless the incident was as i say a very respected ex captain told me the story and i myself could see the scar left on his cheek
p00070_B,00070,B,ah connected doubtless with madame his mother
p00071_B,00071,B,the question is how to raise the fifty thousand francs we cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor listen what of mr astley
p00072_B,00072,B,then i will go however mad be your fancy only look here shall you not be doing the general a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself it is not about myself i am worrying it is about you and the general why for a mere fancy should i go and insult a woman
p00073_B,00073,B,may i ask you who is this mlle blanche
p00074_B,00074,B,why not why not polina
p00075_B,00075,B,yet i dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter
p00076_B,00076,B,to tell the truth i do not know i only know that i must win that it is the one resource i have left yes why do i feel so assured on the point
p00077_B,00077,B,polina you say that again again
p00078_B,00078,B,the frenchman
p00079_B,00079,B,have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the general
p00080_B,00080,B,because you promised to explain matters to me listen i am certain that as soon as ever i begin to play for myself and i still have 120 g lden left i shall win you can then take of me what you require you must not be angry with me for making such a proposal i am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me a gift from me could not possibly offend you moreover it was i who lost your g lden
p00081_B,00081,B,when have i thought to do so
p00082_B,00082,B,a maxim straight from the copybook suppose i cannot comport myself with dignity by that i mean that though i am a man of self respect i am unable to carry off a situation properly do you know the reason it is because we russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression it is all a question of mode most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour and genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists it belongs only to the french though a few other europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons that is why with us the mode is so all important the frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown but a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum that is why our good ladies are so fond of frenchmen the frenchman s manners they say are perfect but in my opinion there is no such thing as a frenchman s manners the frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois at the same time as i am not a woman i do not properly understand the question cocks may be excellent birds if i am wrong you must stop me you ought to stop and correct me more often when i am speaking to you for i am too apt to say everything that is in my head you see i have lost my manners i agree that i have none nor yet any dignity i will tell you why i set no store upon such things everything in me has undergone a cheek you know the reason i have not a single human thought in my head for a long while i have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in russia i have been to dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what dresden is like you know the cause of my obsession i have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore i tell you outright that wherever i go i see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference why or how i have come to love you i do not know it may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon do you know i am ignorant even as to what your face is like in all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble
p00083_B,00083,B,is that so
p00084_B,00084,B,all of you are on the tiptoe of expectation
p00085_B,00085,B,is it likely that the marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother did you notice too that three times during luncheon when speaking of her he called her la baboulenka what loving friendly behaviour to be sure
p00086_B,00086,B,because though the frenchman is the handsomer of the two he is also the baser whereas the englishman is not only a man of honour but ten times the wealthier of the pair
p00087_B,00087,B,something startled me just now and i looked round and saw you some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form
p00088_B,00088,B,and he is ten times richer than the frenchman in fact what does the frenchman possess to me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all
p00089_B,00089,B,i consider that i have a perfect right to put these questions to you for the reason that i am ready to pay for them and also care little what becomes of me
p00090_B,00090,B,well bid me do so and i will go to him by the first train tomorrow
p00091_B,00091,B,why should you yet to think that you should have loved de griers the villain the villain but i will kill him in a duel where is he now
p00092_B,00092,B,and what a fine thing it all is could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone not one of the decencies has been observed the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony and as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead what do you think of it polina alexandrovna
p00093_B,00093,B,looking for it
p00094_B,00094,B,then he has only just begun his courting why i thought he had been doing so a long while
p00095_B,00095,B,well then i will kill whomsoever you wish but are you really going to bid me do such deeds
p00096_B,00096,B,then you throw me out a challenge you think that i will not do it
p00097_B,00097,B,it is de griers handwriting all this is clear enough surely you did not expect aught else from him
p00098_B,00098,B,i knew you would ask about him he is very shy and susceptible also he is in love with you
p00099_B,00099,B,but i am offering it to you as a friend in the same way i would offer you my very life
p00100_B,00100,B,you know that you and i stand on no ceremony and that sometimes i put to you very plain questions i repeat that i am your slave and slaves cannot be shamed or offended
p00101_B,00101,B,or perhaps it is because it is so necessary for you to win it is like a drowning man catching at a straw you yourself will agree that unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree
p00102_B,00102,B,do i or do i not love her
p00103_B,00103,B,oh polina how can you speak so am i de griers
p00104_B,00104,B,splendid i know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me i can see through you of no use did you say why to give pleasure is always of use and as for barbarous unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why it is a kind of luxury man is a despot by nature and loves to torture you in particular love to do so
p00105_B,00105,B,why it will be a case of farewell mlle blanche for in such an event she would never become madame general do you know i believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over at his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love
p00106_B,00106,B,yes they have always been yours
p00107_B,00107,B,that marquis of yours is he also familiar with your family secrets
p00108_B,00108,B,never mind if i am not mistaken the general has succeeded in borrowing money of the marquis
p00109_B,00109,B,because i wish to play for myself that is my sole reason
p00110_B,00110,B,to mr astley
p00111_B,00111,B,i do not know perhaps i am but i do not know i have long given up thinking about such things
p00112_B,00112,B,and is the general at last in love
p00113_B,00113,B,polina give me but an hour wait here just one hour until i return yes you must do so do you not see what i mean just stay here for that time
p00114_B,00114,B,true i always felt certain that i should win indeed what you say makes me ask myself why have my absurd senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind yet i am still positive that so soon as ever i begin to play for myself i shall infallibly win
p00115_B,00115,B,mlle left me but ten minutes ago what can have become of her
p00116_B,00116,B,just as i expected well what is the general going to do what about the grandmother
p00117_B,00117,B,nevertheless in your place i should marry the englishman
p00118_B,00118,B,but the document returning the fifty thousand rouble mortgage has the general got it if so possess yourself of it and send it to de griers
p00119_B,00119,B,not at all i have told you that i find it difficult to explain myself you are hard upon me do not be angry at my chattering you know why you ought not to be angry with me that i am simply an imbecile however i do not mind if you are angry sitting in my room i need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once i fall almost to biting my hands why should you be angry with me because i call myself your slave revel i pray you in my slavery revel in it do you know that sometimes i could kill you not because i do not love you or am jealous of you but because i feel as though i could simply devour you you are laughing
p00120_B,00120,B,i do not care also do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together often i have a feeling that i should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you are you certain that it will never come to that you are driving me to frenzy am i afraid of a scandal or of your anger why should i fear your anger i love without hope and know that hereafter i shall love you a thousand times more if ever i should kill you i should have to kill myself too but i shall put off doing so as long as possible for i wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me do you know a very strange thing it is that with every day my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility why should i not become a fatalist remember how on the third day that we ascended the shlangenberg i was moved to whisper in your ear had you said it i should have leapt do you not believe me
p00121_B,00121,B,what the money that you gave me to lose i told you i should never win for other people least of all for you i obeyed you simply because you ordered me to but you must not blame me for the result i warned you that no good would ever come of it you seem much depressed at having lost your money why do you need it so greatly
p00122_B,00122,B,madame la baronne j ai l honneur d tre votre esclave
p00123_B,00123,B,then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged i have heard rumours to that effect but was unaware how far they might be true
p00124_B,00124,B,yes possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in peace i am not unwilling so to do but in all probability i should lose
p00125_B,00125,B,do you rather tell me what is going on here why do you seem half afraid of me i can see for myself what is wrong you are the step daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a blanche and there is this frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you yet you actually ask me such a question if you do not tell me how things stand i shall have to put in my oar and do something are you ashamed to be frank with me are you shy of me
p00126_B,00126,B,i care not whether it be wise or stupid i only know that in your presence i must speak speak speak therefore i am speaking i lose all conceit when i am with you and everything ceases to matter
p00127_B,00127,B,by the way you say you want to pay off a debt it must be a large one is it to the frenchman
p00128_B,00128,B,yes i believe that you will come in for a good deal
p00129_B,00129,B,why the fact that you are here
p00130_B,00130,B,have you then you can take the consequences
p00131_B,00131,B,ah then i can see that you are only a trifler your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon do i not know that what i have asked you to do is foolish and wrong and that the general will be angry about it but i want to have a good laugh all the same i want that and nothing else why should you insult a woman indeed well you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing
p00132_B,00132,B,you know who she is just mlle blanche nothing further has transpired probably she will soon be madame general that is to say if the rumours that grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true mlle blanche with her mother and her cousin the marquis know very well that as things now stand we are ruined
p00133_B,00133,B,i am not going to take your money
p00134_B,00134,B,what do you mean by asking all these questions you are very clever today surely you are not drunk
p00135_B,00135,B,i do not care whether you are so or not well since you ask me i do doubt your ability to take anything seriously you are capable of worrying but not deeply you are too ill regulated and unsettled a person for that but why do you want money not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious
p00136_B,00136,B,you why i hate you yes yes i hate you i love you no more than i do de griers buy me would you would you would you buy me for fifty thousand francs as de griers did you love me do you you who were willing even to quarrel with the baron at my bidding no no you are my dear one you are the man i trust you love me you love me will you always love me yes yes he is there open the window and see if he is not shall we go away tomorrow how would it be if we were to try and overtake grandmamma i think we should do so at berlin and what think you she would have to say to us when we caught her up and her eyes first lit upon us what too about mr astley he would not leap from the shlangenberg for my sake no of that i am very sure do you know where he is going next year he says he intends to go to the north pole for scientific investigations and has invited me to go with him ha ha ha he also says that we russians know nothing can do nothing without european help but he is a good fellow all the same for instance he does not blame the general in the matter but declares that mlle blanche that love but no i do not know i do not know what poor creatures these people are how sorry i am for them and for grandmamma but when are you going to kill de griers surely you do not intend actually to murder him you fool do you suppose that i should allow you to fight de griers nor shall you kill the baron how absurd you looked when you were talking to the burmergelms i was watching you all the time watching you from where i was sitting and how unwilling you were to go when i sent you oh how i laughed and laughed well are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs
p00137_B,00137,B,yes i do challenge you go for such is my will
p00138_B,00138,B,yes they are true what then
p00139_B,00139,B,what do not you also hope something from it did you not tell me again and again two weeks ago that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here and did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so were you joking you cannot have been for i remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting
p00140_B,00140,B,you are losing the thread of the argument if you do not wish to purchase me at all events you wish to purchase my respect
p00141_B,00141,B,and because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money
p00142_B,00142,B,yes absolutely it amuses me to see you grow angry however inasmuch as i allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures you ought to pay me something for the privilege
p00143_B,00143,B,of course all of us and every minute of the day for a year and a half now we have been looking for this
p00144_B,00144,B,yes that is true as soon as ever he learnt that i was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses i thought you ought to know that
p00145_B,00145,B,yes but then the frenchman is a marquis and the cleverer of the two
p00146_B,00146,B,if you were to do that he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs what then would be the use of having a quarrel with him you talk sheer nonsense
p00147_B,00147,B,oh no there is no doubt about it he does possess some ch teau or other last night the general told me that for certain now are you satisfied
p00148_B,00148,B,last time you told me when on the shlangenberg that at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss some day i may remind you of that saying in order to see if you will be as good as your word yes you may depend upon it that i shall do so i hate you because i have allowed you to go to such lengths and i also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me for the time being i want you so i must keep you
p00149_B,00149,B,in frankfort where he will be staying for the next three days
p00150_B,00150,B,because i am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing
p00151_B,00151,B,why do you ask me these questions
p00152_B,00152,B,yes looking for it i am not her blood relation you know i am merely the general s step daughter yet i am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will
p00153_B,00153,B,you know he has not but where on earth did you pick up this englishman
p00154_B,00154,B,no i am not but i order you nevertheless to be silent what rubbish
p00155_B,00155,B,if i said to you kill that man would you kill him
p00156_B,00156,B,then take your fifty thousand francs
p00157_B,00157,B,yes he is in love with me
p00158_B,00158,B,i am not going to talk to you on that subject i have asked you a question and am waiting for an answer
p00159_B,00159,B,and why are you so certain
p00160_B,00160,B,then are you so certain that your roulette playing will get us out of our difficulties
p00161_B,00161,B,what makes you speak of her i cannot go and live with her nor will i go down upon my knees to any one
p00162_B,00162,B,you are giving too much for me the beloved of de griers is not worth fifty thousand francs
p00163_B,00163,B,yes it is very horrible consequently i am the more surprised that you should be so cheerful what are you so pleased about about the fact that you have gone and lost my money
p00164_B,00164,B,you have changed your mind then ha ha ha you are sorry you ever promised them the francs are mine then are they they are mine
p00165_B,00165,B,and why are you yourself so interested in them
p00166_B,00166,B,it may be so
p00167_B,00167,B,well absurd though it be i place great hopes on your playing of roulette wherefore you ought to play as my partner and on equal shares wherefore of course you will do as i wish
p00168_B,00168,B,take this letter and hand it personally to mr astley go as quickly as ever you can please no answer will be required he himself
p00169_B,00169,B,do not ask me questions return me answers i repeat whomsoever i wish i desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now
p00170_B,00170,B,that has nothing to do with it listen to me take these 700 florins and go and play roulette with them win as much for me as you can for i am badly in need of money
p00171_B,00171,B,what you yourself wish me to leave you for him
p00172_B,00172,B,perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so
p00173_B,00173,B,if i am here i have come with all that i have to bring such has always been my way as you shall presently see please light a candle read it
p00174_B,00174,B,no no the general has not got it
p00175_B,00175,B,and why
p00176_B,00176,B,what stupid rubbish
p00177_B,00177,B,why should i have wanted you to leap from the shlangenberg that would have been of no use to me
p00178_B,00178,B,my affairs cannot possibly interest you still if you do wish to know i am in debt i borrowed some money and must pay it back again i have a curious senseless idea that i am bound to win at the gaming tables why i think so i cannot tell but i do think so and with some assurance perhaps it is because of that assurance that i now find myself without any other resource
p00179_B,00179,B,hush not so loud
p00180_B,00180,B,yes something i believe will happen to him
p00181_B,00181,B,yes and i suppose you want to know why you are aware are you not that the general is mortgaged to the marquis with all his property consequently if the general s mother does not die the frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge
p00182_B,00182,B,why should you think that i am going to let you off i shall bid you do it or else renounce me could you ever do the latter no you know that you couldn t you would first kill whom i had bidden you and then kill me for having dared to send you away do you see that fat baroness it is the baroness burmergelm she arrived three days ago just look at her husband that tall wizened prussian there with the stick in his hand do you remember how he stared at us the other day well go to the baroness take off your hat to her and say something in french
p00183_B,00183,B,oh no why so i believe you surely you are not a coward
p00184_B,00184,B,you talk like a child it is always possible to comport oneself with dignity if one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one
p00185_B,00185,B,yes for she is fond of me but how come you to think so
p00186_B,00186,B,i expected nothing at all from him long ago i made up my mind on the subject for i could read his thoughts and knew what he was thinking he thought that possibly i should sue him that one day i might become a nuisance so of set purpose i redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him and waited to see what he would do if a telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from st petersburg i should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debts and then dismissed him for a long time i have hated him even in earlier days he was not a man and now oh how gladly i could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face and spit in it and then rub the spittle in
p00187_B,00187,B,damn the gambling yes i should certainly have given it up were it not that
p00188_B,00188,B,which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than i am
p00189_B,00189,B,yet he possesses a good circle of friends
p00190_B,00190,B,then see here on the one hand you are a sugar refiner while on the other hand you are an apollo belvedere but the two characters do not mix with one another i again am not even a sugar refiner i am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey of this fact mlle polina is probably well aware since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal
p00191_B,00191,B,then you are minded to keep her there
p00192_B,00192,B,and she is in your rooms
p00193_B,00193,B,no mr astley after all that has been said i
p00194_B,00194,B,what a strange thing for i know no russians at all here so it cannot have been a russian who befriended me in russia we orthodox folk do go bail for one another but in this case i thought it must have been done by some english stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country
p00195_B,00195,B,yes yes that is so for me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment whereas if i remain i should be able to defend their interests and perhaps to save a moiety of their property yes yes that is quite true and yet and yet oh i can well understand why they are all so interested in the general s mother
p00196_B,00196,B,but why should she be calling me hear her calling again see she is beckoning to us
p00197_B,00197,B,indeed then i wish you joy mr astley apropos you have reminded me of something were you beneath my window last night every moment mlle polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there after which she always smiled
p00198_B,00198,B,then you know all about it
p00199_B,00199,B,and what of mlle blanche
p00200_B,00200,B,i really cannot say
p00201_B,00201,B,what a splendid fellow you are mr astley and since i have not yet had my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely tasted yours let us adjourn to the casino caf where we can sit and smoke and have a talk i do not intend to go away i intend on the contrary to remain here
p00202_B,00202,B,enough you need say no more very well very well then i stand confounded and have no further opinions to offer but you are a good fellow and i am glad to know what you think about it all even though i do not need your advice for instance what reason should you assign for the general taking fright in this way why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident even de griers has found it necessary to put in his oar and he only interferes on the most important occasions and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplications yes he de griers has actually been playing the suppliant to me and mark you although he came to me as early as nine o clock he had ready prepared in his hand mlle polina s note when i would ask was that note written mlle polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it at all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the frenchman since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon yet what is her personal concern in the matter why is she interested in it at all why too is the whole party so afraid of this precious baron and what sort of a business do you call it for the general to be going to marry mlle blanche de cominges he told me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at present what is your opinion of it all your look convinces me that you know more about it than i do
p00203_B,00203,B,then i beg your pardon a thousand times mr astley i meant nothing offensive to mlle polina for i have nothing of which to accuse her moreover the question of there being anything between this frenchman and this russian lady is not one which you and i need discuss nor even attempt to understand
p00204_B,00204,B,quite so quite so i admit that yet that is not the question what do you make of it when i met you i was just coming to ask you your opinion for myself i could have killed this frenchman and am not sure that i shall not do so even yet
p00205_B,00205,B,oh oh
p00206_B,00206,B,what in spite of our old friendship
p00207_B,00207,B,i agree but therein lies the horror of it all that how trepidation playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be they are none the less true but i am only wasting words
p00208_B,00208,B,what you think that he is waiting for that
p00209_B,00209,B,no i have never noticed whether she does so or not
p00210_B,00210,B,no i fear not
p00211_B,00211,B,she ought to see a doctor you know mr astley
p00212_B,00212,B,good bye but i am not going to paris likewise pardon me what is to become of this family i mean that the affair of the general and mlle polina will soon be all over the town
p00213_B,00213,B,perhaps i shall need it for a meal
p00214_B,00214,B,no i know nothing for certain about them no nothing
p00215_B,00215,B,how closely you watch the doings of your old friends that does you infinite credit but stop a moment you have reminded me of something was it you who bailed me out of roulettenberg prison when i was lying there for a debt of two hundred g lden someone did so
p00216_B,00216,B,where have you been today
p00217_B,00217,B,yes certainly
p00218_B,00218,B,and de griers is he too travelling in switzerland
p00219_B,00219,B,indeed is that really so
p00220_B,00220,B,yes and de griers
p00221_B,00221,B,yes i will take it if at the same time you will embrace me
p00222_B,00222,B,how do you know that is every one aware of the fact
p00223_B,00223,B,then how come you to know it
p00224_B,00224,B,no i do not tell me mr astley why if you knew this history all along and consequently always knew who this mlle blanche is you never warned either myself or the general nor most of all mlle polina how could you do it
p00225_B,00225,B,enough mr astley kindly do not recall to me any more recollections for i can remember things for myself only for a time have i put them out of my head only until i shall have rehabilitated myself am i keeping my memory dulled when that hour shall come you will see me arise from the dead
p00226_B,00226,B,i suppose he means to shoot me in a duel should polina die yes that is what he intends to do
p00227_B,00227,B,but why
p00228_B,00228,B,ah i see you are interested mr astley but it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface at the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance a frenchman mr astley is merely a fine figure of a man with this you as a britisher may not agree with it i also as a russian may not agree out of envy yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion for instance one may look upon racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and i too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule yet about him mr astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it yes the frenchman the parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we russians had even ceased to be bears the revolution bequeathed to the french nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance yes taken by himself the frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young russian lady de griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure mr astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him and even though it may offend you i feel bound to say that the majority also of english people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same but to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies at all events they need more experience for instance this mlle polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and i cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to monsieur de griers she may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer de griers this will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that de griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old general and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind only give her the de griers of former days and she will ask of you no more the more she may detest the present de griers the more will she lament the de griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination you are a sugar refiner mr astley are you not
p00229_B,00229,B,on business
p00230_B,00230,B,say no more and to show you that i have not wholly forgotten the past may i enquire where mlle polina is if it was not you who bailed me out of prison it must have been she yet never have i heard a word concerning her
p00231_B,00231,B,indeed on what subject then have i a better right to speak to you than on this with it are bound up all your recollections and mine however do not be alarmed i have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affairs my interest in mlle polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings about them you could tell me in two words
p00232_B,00232,B,do you know what i believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from mlle polina herself
p00233_B,00233,B,pardon me but what do you mean
p00234_B,00234,B,no i won a hundred thousand florins
p00235_B,00235,B,but i do i do he is waiting also for the old woman s will for the reason that it awards mlle polina a dowry as soon as ever the money is received she will throw herself upon the frenchman s neck all women are like that even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned what polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love that is my opinion look at her especially when she is sitting alone and plunged in thought all this was pre ordained and foretold and is accursed polina could perpetrate any mad act she she but who called me by name who is shouting for me i heard some one calling in russian it was a woman s voice listen
p00236_B,00236,B,no none whatever
p00237_B,00237,B,in the old woman of moscow who declines to die yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death
p00238_B,00238,B,enough to me it is as clear as day that mlle polina knows all about this mlle blanche but cannot bring herself to part with her frenchman wherefore she consents also to be seen in public with mlle blanche you may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the baron yes it is there that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow yet she herself it was who launched me at the baron the devil take it but i was left no choice in the matter
p00239_B,00239,B,perhaps you could tell me who did bail me out
p00240_B,00240,B,but what could i do in paris in summer time i love her mr astley surely you know that
p00241_B,00241,B,but mr astley that will raise a scandal it ought not to be allowed besides she is very ill perhaps you had not remarked that
p00242_B,00242,B,at all events she in her turn has promised to give me an explanation to night and to reveal to me something or another
p00243_B,00243,B,which means that she has dealt you a serious wound
p00244_B,00244,B,yes i belong to the well known firm of lovell and co
p00245_B,00245,B,that you are losing i thought so you need not tell me any more i know how things stand for you have said that last in despair and therefore truthfully have you no other employment than gambling
p00246_B,00246,B,also i may tell you that mlle blanche has been in roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago i myself was in the place at the time and in those days mlle blanche was not known as mlle de cominges nor was her mother the widow de cominges even in existence in any case no one ever mentioned the latter de griers too had not materialised and i am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance likewise the marquisate de griers is of recent creation of that i have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance even the name de griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that i have a friend who once met the said marquis under a different name altogether
p00247_B,00247,B,yes i am minded to keep her there
p00248_B,00248,B,yes she is in my rooms
p00249_B,00249,B,indeed she arrived at the casino even before i had taken my departure by train so i knew she had been playing if i should have time i will go to the casino to night and take a look at her the thing interests me
p00250_B,00250,B,you are saying this because you are feeling bitter yet there is not the least originality in your words
p00251_B,00251,B,yes you are for you are only talking nonsense are you aware that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you are it was at her request i came to homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes and your recollections of her too
p00252_B,00252,B,well i must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name barberini or something of the kind the fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage at first mlle blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse i distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum but worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous upon this mlle zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as madame barberini was in despair she shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy in the hotel there was staying also a polish count you must know that all travelling poles are counts and the spectacle of mlle zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression so the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled indeed that evening the couple entered the casino arm in arm mlle zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown for instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside doubtless you have noticed them
p00253_B,00253,B,yes i did hear a woman s voice calling but whose i do not know the someone was calling you in russian ah now i can see whence the cries come they come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys behind her see that pile of luggage she must have arrived by train
p00254_B,00254,B,ah then of course their interests centre around her it is a question of succession let that but be settled and the general will marry mlle polina will be set free and de griers
p00255_B,00255,B,what you cannot say
p00256_B,00256,B,and concerning this marquis and mlle polina you know nothing beyond surmise
p00257_B,00257,B,well my belief is that at the present moment mlle blanche has in very truth a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the baron and the baroness it might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a scandal
p00258_B,00258,B,no nor do i know where he is also i warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me
p00259_B,00259,B,your eyes look very fiery and in them i can read suspicion now you have no right whatever to be suspicious it is not a right which i can for a moment recognise and i absolutely refuse to answer your questions
p00260_B,00260,B,possibly mlle blanche also may possess that yet it is not three years since she received from the local police at the instance of the baroness an invitation to leave the town and she left it
p00261_B,00261,B,your remarks please me as they always did in those words i see the clever triumphant and above all things cynical friend of former days only russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded all thinking persons know that ancient truth yet on the present occasion i assure you i am sincerely glad to see that you are not cast down tell me are you never going to give up gambling
p00262_B,00262,B,yes for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative of mine unfortunately being ill she made a mistake and went to your rooms instead
p00263_B,00263,B,hm then i have an idea in my mind
p00264_B,00264,B,then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine things about them
p00265_B,00265,B,yes poor unfortunate she did love you and i may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost even if i were also to tell you that she still loves you you would none the less have to remain where you are yes you have ruined yourself beyond redemption once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent and you were of a lively disposition and your good looks were not to be despised you might even have been useful to your country which needs men like you yet you remained here and your life is now over i am not blaming you for this in my view all russians resemble you or are inclined to do so if it is not roulette then it is something else the exceptions are very rare nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours for roulette is not exclusively a russian game hitherto you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you i tremble to think now good bye you are in want of money i suppose then take these ten louis d or more i shall not give you for you would only gamble it away take care of these coins and farewell once more take care of them
p00266_B,00266,B,with pleasure
p00267_B,00267,B,no i do not think it was she at the present moment she is in switzerland and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her
p00268_B,00268,B,indeed no i was not there but i was waiting in the corridor and walking about the hotel
p00269_B,00269,B,i daresay yet i hardly suppose that that will break the general s heart moreover mlle polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses in short we may say that as a family this family has ceased to exist
p00270_B,00270,B,to frankfort
p00271_B,00271,B,it would have done no good to warn you for the reason that you could have effected nothing against what was i to warn you as likely as not the general knows more about mlle blanche even than i do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and mlle polina only yesterday i saw this frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with de griers while the general was careering in their wake on a roan horse he had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough as he passed i looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever however it is no affair of mine for i have only recently had the happiness to make mlle polina s acquaintance also i have already told you that i do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you
p00272_B,00272,B,yes she ought i have sent for one and if she dies i shall hold you responsible
p00273_B,00273,B,no i am afraid i could not
p00274_B,00274,B,i feel the same about it as for mlle polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances for my own part i think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially and as for mlle polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as mlle polina are to say the least of it unbecoming but she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter
p00275_B,00275,B,i know of nothing else
p00276_B,00276,B,take care of them i am certain you are still a gentleman and therefore i give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another also if i could be certain that you would leave both homburg and the gaming tables and return to your own country i would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh but i give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other take the money therefore and good bye
p00277_B,00277,B,because i have had occasion to do so whither are you bound i like you and was therefore coming to pay you a visit
p00278_B,00278,B,that i never doubted
p00279_B,00279,B,you forget in the first place that this mlle de cominges is the general s inamorata and in the second place that mlle polina the general s step daughter has a younger brother and sister who though they are the general s own children are completely neglected by this madman and robbed as well
p00280_B,00280,B,you are growing blas you have not only renounced life with its interests and social ties but the duties of a citizen and a man you have not only renounced the friends whom i know you to have had and every aim in life but that of winning money but you have also renounced your memory though i can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life i feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle numbers and so forth
p00281_B,00281,B,oh dear no though i knew all the time that you were lying there
p00282_B,00282,B,well they are not worth noticing to the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart however mlle zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal suddenly the count too disappeared even as the prince had done and that same evening mlle zelma was forced to appear in the casino alone on this occasion no one offered her a greeting two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the baron burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval to his distaste however mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red later that evening a complaint from the baroness led the authorities to request mlle not to re enter the casino if you feel in any way surprised that i should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that i had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove mlle zelma in his carriage from roulettenberg to spa now mark you mlle wants to become madame general in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from casino authorities as she received three years ago at present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players yes that is a much more paying game i even suspect that the unfortunate general is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also de griers or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the baron and the baroness drawn to herself in short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental you form a member of the m nage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the general or with mlle polina now do you understand
p00283_B,00283,B,if you do not care to hear their names coupled together may i ask you what you mean by the expressions and there being anything between them why do you call them so particularly a frenchman and a russian lady
p00284_B,00284,B,on business
p00285_B,00285,B,yes in spite of our old friendship
p00286_B,00286,B,mlle polina is the best of all possible living beings but i repeat that i shall thank you to cease questioning me about her you never really knew her and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling
p00287_B,00287,B,yes i think i do know more about it than you do the affair centres around this mlle blanche of that i feel certain
p00288_B,00288,B,never mind tell me if it is true that last night you won two hundred thousand thalers
p00289_B,00289,B,good heavens then i suppose you will be off to paris this morning
p00290_B,00290,B,yes so she is
p00291_B,00291,B,then you will have to be here another ten years should i then be alive i will remind you here on this very bench of what i have just said in fact i will bet you a wager that i shall do so
p00292_B,00292,B,will be repaid his money which is what he is now waiting for
p00293_B,00293,B,in whom
p00294_B,00294,B,well i am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your buoyancy
p00295_B,00295,B,indeed i am sure that you do not moreover if you were to stay here you would lose everything that you possess and have nothing left with which to pay your expenses in paris well good bye now i feel sure that today will see you gone from here
p00296_B,00296,B,yes i have it was i who told you about it had she not been ill she would not have gone and spent the night with you
p00297_B,00297,B,by no means not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment indeed i have never heard any one speak of it
p00298_B,00298,B,well on condition that the matter shall end there i will tell you that for a long time mlle polina was ill and still is so my mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of england and thereafter mlle polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman died and left mlle polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling that was about six months ago and now mlle is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married mlle s little brother and sister also benefited by the grandmother s will and are now being educated in london as for the general he died in paris last month of a stroke mlle blanche did well by him for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the grandmother that i think concludes all that i have to tell
p00299_B,00299,B,oh no it is not true and you you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country
p00300_B,00300,B,and then you will have ruined my whole family i and my family are her heirs for she has no nearer relatives than ourselves i tell you frankly that my affairs are in great very great disorder how much they are so you yourself are partially aware if she should lose a large sum or maybe her whole fortune what will become of us of my children or of me alexis ivanovitch i beg of you to save us
p00301_B,00301,B,alexis ivanovitch pray pardon me for having said what i did just now for having said more than i meant to do i beg and beseech you i kiss the hem of your garment as our russian saying has it for you and only you can save us i and mlle de cominges we all of us beg of you but you understand do you not surely you understand
p00302_B,00302,B,i have come to see you on business nor will i seek to conceal from you the fact that i have come in the capacity of an emissary of an intermediary from the general having small knowledge of the russian tongue i lost most of what was said last night but the general has now explained matters and i must confess that
p00303_B,00303,B,eh ce n est pas a mon cher monsieur notre g n ral se trompe what he means to say is that he warns you he begs of you most earnestly not to ruin him i use the expression because
p00304_B,00304,B,nous boirons du lait sur l herbe fraiche
p00305_B,00305,B,and what a russian idea
p00306_B,00306,B,mais madame cela sera un plaisir
p00307_B,00307,B,because he is a brute
p00308_B,00308,B,sind sie rasend
p00309_B,00309,B,hein hein
p00310_B,00310,B,ja wo o ohl
p00311_B,00311,B,ja wohl
p00312_B,00312,B,but you have no money with which to do it madame in this satchel i can see only a few five percent bonds and some transfers no actual cash
p00313_B,00313,B,madame your twelve thousand g lden are now gone
p00314_B,00314,B,i wanted to challenge the baron to a duel but the general protested against my doing so
p00315_B,00315,B,half past eight
p00316_B,00316,B,no madame
p00317_B,00317,B,but perhaps he is not a beggar only a rascal
p00318_B,00318,B,but whither madame
p00319_B,00319,B,i cannot madame the largest stake allowed is four thousand g lden
p00320_B,00320,B,but madame zero has only this moment turned up wherefore it may not do so again for ever so long wait a little and you may then have a better chance
p00321_B,00321,B,think a moment madame sometimes zero does not turn up for two hundred rounds in succession i assure you that you may lose all your capital
p00322_B,00322,B,what you are going to play again
p00323_B,00323,B,two hundred g lden madame
p00324_B,00324,B,because the other day there arrived from berlin a german and his wife persons of some importance and it chanced that when taking a walk i spoke to them in german without having properly compassed the berlin accent
p00325_B,00325,B,and this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after making her will yet she will outlive us and every one else in the hotel good lord what is going to become of us now what on earth is to happen to the general she will turn the place upside down
p00326_B,00326,B,yes i thank you antonida vassilievna
p00327_B,00327,B,after tomorrow i shall no longer be in the general s service but merely living in the hotel on my own account
p00328_B,00328,B,neither upon that accursed zero however nor upon that equally accursed red do i mean to stake a cent
p00329_B,00329,B,mlle de cominges and this is her mother madame de cominges they also are staying in the hotel
p00330_B,00330,B,no i did not the baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me
p00331_B,00331,B,the clerk says that others will give you even less than he
p00332_B,00332,B,for every one seems to know about that affair or perhaps i am the only one who does not know about it
p00333_B,00333,B,presently madame potapitch is outside and they would decline to admit him to these rooms see you are being paid out your money pray take it
p00334_B,00334,B,pardon me antonida vassilievna i have no reason to wish you ill i am merely rather astonished to see you why should i not be so seeing how unexpected
p00335_B,00335,B,a mr astley
p00336_B,00336,B,he stayed behind in the casino
p00337_B,00337,B,but madame i only explained the game to you how am i to answer for every mischance which may occur in it
p00338_B,00338,B,pardon me but i have nothing to reproach myself with i merely will not go i merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play i also beg to return you your five hundred g lden farewell
p00339_B,00339,B,a fellow traveller and my very good friend as well as an acquaintance of the general s
p00340_B,00340,B,i cannot take it upon myself to advise you for you will only blame me if i do so play at your own discretion say exactly what you wish staked and i will stake it
p00341_B,00341,B,but the rules do not allow of more than 120 g lden being staked upon zero at a time
p00342_B,00342,B,zero is what the bank takes for itself if the wheel stops at that figure everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of the bank also whenever the wheel has begun to turn the bank ceases to pay out anything
p00343_B,00343,B,would one of the clerks do madame
p00344_B,00344,B,i thank you humbly madame but i am ashamed to
p00345_B,00345,B,my good madame
p00346_B,00346,B,with your leave madame i will not go with you
p00347_B,00347,B,yes and probably all of them
p00348_B,00348,B,yes polina alexandrovna is here
p00349_B,00349,B,no unless by any chance you had purposely staked on zero in which case you would receive thirty five times the value of your stake
p00350_B,00350,B,quite so to any amount you please but you will lose on the transaction what would frighten even a jew
p00351_B,00351,B,farewell then madame
p00352_B,00352,B,she is i believe a frenchwoman
p00353_B,00353,B,the next train leaves at 9 30 madame
p00354_B,00354,B,does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup
p00355_B,00355,B,a couple of steps madame
p00356_B,00356,B,here we are madame here is the moneychanger s office
p00357_B,00357,B,doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose
p00358_B,00358,B,good lord every ten g lden piece which the grandmother staked must have raised a blister on the general s heart and maddened de griers and driven mlle de cominges almost to frenzy with the sight of this spoon dangling before her lips
p00359_B,00359,B,we have lost 144 ten g lden pieces i tell you madame that zero may not turn up until nightfall
p00360_B,00360,B,upon what shall i stake madame
p00361_B,00361,B,a mere trifle
p00362_B,00362,B,pardon me but zero might not turn up again until say tonight even though you had staked thousands upon it it often happens so
p00363_B,00363,B,because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty six
p00364_B,00364,B,but such a quantity of money
p00365_B,00365,B,but madame that will be so much to venture suppose the red should not turn up
p00366_B,00366,B,i do mean to try my luck presently
p00367_B,00367,B,yes i have just been to the casino
p00368_B,00368,B,she has lost this morning s winnings and also twelve thousand g lden of her original money at the present moment we are going to get some bonds changed
p00369_B,00369,B,but i suppose you must have threatened that precious baron or something of the kind however even if you did so it was a matter of no moment
p00370_B,00370,B,ah a bird of passage evidently besides i can see that she has her shoes polished now explain to me the meaning of each round in the game and the way in which one ought to stake but what is zero just now i heard the flaxen haired croupier call out zero and why does he keep raking in all the money that is on the table to think that he should grab the whole pile for himself what does zero mean
p00371_B,00371,B,you and your mischances go away at once
p00372_B,00372,B,what folly very well then do not come and i will find my way alone potapitch you must come with me lift up the chair and carry me along
p00373_B,00373,B,rubbish rubbish who fears the wolf should never enter the forest what we have lost then stake again
p00374_B,00374,B,why should you be astonished i just got into my chair and came things are quiet enough in the train for there is no one there to chatter have you been out for a walk
p00375_B,00375,B,the thieves never mind though get the documents cashed no send the banker out to me
p00376_B,00376,B,and why did you so protest for i can see no difference between you and the baron nor can i bear that german visage of yours
p00377_B,00377,B,never mind keep on staking upon zero and also stake a thousand g lden upon rouge here is a banknote with which to do so but you see you see we have now recovered almost all that we staked try zero again let us do so another ten times and then leave off to the devil with that zero stake four thousand g lden upon the red
p00378_B,00378,B,no i don t want to see them i hate kissing children for their noses are always wet how are you getting on theodosia
p00379_B,00379,B,you are wrong utterly wrong stake i tell you what a chattering tongue you have i know perfectly well what i am doing
p00380_B,00380,B,i cannot rest until i have retrieved my losses march on ahead and ask me no questions play continues until midnight does it not
p00381_B,00381,B,what you permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus you nincompoop and to dismiss him from his post you are a blockhead an utter blockhead i can see that clearly
p00382_B,00382,B,yes one of the clerks the thieves pray recollect yourself and may my money choke you alexis ivanovitch tell him that we can easily repair to someone else

p00466_B,00466,B,i do not know for certain grandmamma but from mlle blanche s account for she does not appear to think it necessary to conceal anything i conclude that
p00467_B,00467,B,grandmamma i am very very grateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me also to a certain extent you have guessed my position aright and i am beholden to you to such an extent that it may be that i will come and live with you and that very soon yet there are important reasons why why i cannot make up my mind just yet if you would let me have say a couple of weeks to decide in
p00468_B,00468,B,no grandmamma it is my own
p00469_B,00469,B,and how are you grandmother were you long on the journey

p00473_B,00473,B,i mean only that i cannot come just yet at all events i could not well leave my little brother and sister here since since if i were to leave them they would be abandoned altogether but if grandmamma you would take the little ones and myself then of course i could come with you and would do all i could to serve you only without the little ones i cannot come

p00479_B,00479,B,you need not say any more i understand the situation i always thought we should get something like this from him for i always looked upon him as a futile frivolous fellow who gave himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a general though he only became one because he retired as a colonel yes i know all about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon ah they were looking for the legacies without money that wretched woman what is her name oh de cominges would never dream of accepting the general and his false teeth no not even for him to be her lacquey since she herself they say possesses a pile of money and lends it on interest and makes a good thing out of it however it is not you prascovia that i am blaming it was not you who sent those telegrams nor for that matter do i wish to recall old scores true i know that you are a vixen by nature that you are a wasp which will sting one if one touches it yet my heart is sore for you for i loved your mother katerina now will you leave everything here and come away with me otherwise i do not know what is to become of you and it is not right that you should continue living with these people nay i have not yet finished i ask of you nothing in return my house in moscow is as you know large enough for a palace and you could occupy a whole floor of it if you liked and keep away from me for weeks together will you come with me or will you not

p00482_B,00482,B,the most sensible question that i have yet been asked well you shall hear for yourself how it all happened i lay and lay and was doctored and doctored until at last i drove the physicians from me and called in an apothecary from nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady similar to my own cured her merely with a little hayseed well he did me a great deal of good for on the third day i broke into a sweat and was able to leave my bed then my german doctors held another consultation put on their spectacles and told me that if i would go abroad and take a course of the waters the indisposition would finally pass away why should it not i thought to myself so i had got things ready and on the following day a friday set out for here i occupied a special compartment in the train and where ever i had to change i found at the station bearers who were ready to carry me for a few coppers you have nice quarters here but where on earth did you get the money for them my good sir i thought that everything of yours had been mortgaged this frenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal oh i know all about it all about it
