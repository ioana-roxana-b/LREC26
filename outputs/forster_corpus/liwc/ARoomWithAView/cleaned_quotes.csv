Q205,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish,Lucy,['Mr. Beebe']
Q206,the two ladies at all events have made it up,Mr. Beebe,['Lucy']
Q207,oh dear miss honeychurch you will catch a chill and mr beebe here besides who would suppose this is italy there is my sister actually nursing the hot water can no comforts or proper provisions,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']"

Q209,fa niente sono vecchia,The Chambermaid,['Mr. Beebe']
Q210,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Catherine Alan']"
Q211,that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Catherine Alan']"
Q212,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']"
Q213,what was that,Lucy,"['Mr. Beebe', 'Miss Catherine Alan']"
Q214,it was a novel and i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink she said but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour this novel is to be about modern italy the other was historical but that she could not start till she had an idea first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came here this must on no account get round and so cheerful through it all i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']"
Q215,all the same she is a little too i hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']"
Q216,i don t know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely,Miss Catherine Alan,"['Lucy', 'Mr. Beebe']"
Q217,stomach he warned miss pole of her stomach acidity he called it and he may have meant to be kind i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought she thought they were commercial travellers was the word she used and all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson then miss lavish said just imagine tut the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak i said it was horrible speaking i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice the woman i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place but that was not all after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers,Miss Catherine Alan,['Lucy']
Q218,let me finish the story,Mr. Beebe,"['Lucy', 'Miss Catherine Alan']"

Q589,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q590,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']

Q603,i quite agree at present she has none,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q604,at present,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q605,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q606,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q607,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q608,in what way,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q609,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q610,but the string never broke,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']

Q612,it has broken now,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q613,broken what do you mean,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q614,i meant that she is going to marry me,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q615,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q616,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q617,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q618,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet,Cecil,['Mr. Beebe']
Q619,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q620,she has learnt through you,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']
Q621,let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her,Mr. Beebe,['Cecil']

Q635,one has to go through it i suppose they won t notice us so much next time,Lucy,['Cecil']
Q636,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such,Cecil,['Lucy']
Q637,how tiresome couldn t you have escaped to tennis,Lucy,['Cecil']
