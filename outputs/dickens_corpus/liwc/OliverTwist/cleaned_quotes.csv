Q1946,then what the devil is to be done are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1947,not exactly that but we must proceed gently and with great care,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1948,gentleness and care i d send them one and all to,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1949,never mind where but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1950,what object,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1951,simply the discovery of oliver s parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"

Q1954,hanging a few of them at least in all probability and transporting the rest,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1955,very good but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interest or at least to oliver s which is the same thing,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1956,how,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1957,thus it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man monks upon his knees that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1958,then i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1959,do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray the promise shall be kept i don t think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1960,i should like to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1961,i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1962,we must put it to the vote who may he be,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1963,that lady s son and this young lady s very old friend,Mr. Losberne,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
Q1964,we stay in town of course while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains,Mrs. Maylie,"['Mr. Brownlow', 'Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie']"
Q1965,good and as i see on the faces about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate oliver s tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story believe me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough come supper has been announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world,Mr. Brownlow,"['Mr. Losberne', 'Rose Maylie', 'Mrs. Maylie']"
